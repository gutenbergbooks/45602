OF SEAS AND LAKES.</p>


<p>The ocean surrounds the earth on all sides,
and penetrates into the interior parts of
different countries, often by large openings,
and frequently by small straits; it forms mediterranean
seas, some of which participate of its
motions of flux and reflux, and others seem to
have nothing in common with it except the
continuity of water. We shall follow the
ocean through all its extent and windings, enumerating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
at the same time all the mediterranean
seas, and endeavour to distinguish them from
those which should be only called bays, or
gulphs, and lakes.</p>

<p>The sea which washes the western coasts of
France forms a gulph between Spain and
Britain; this gulph, which mariners call the
Bay of Biscay, is very open, and the point
which projects farthest inland is between
Bayonne and St. Sebastian; another great projection
is between Rochelle and Rochefort:
this gulph begins at Cape Ortegal, and ends
at Brest, where a strait commences between
the south point of Britain and Cape Lizard.
This strait, which at first is very large, forms
a small gulph in Normandy, the most projecting
point of which is at Auranche; it continues
pretty broad until it comes to the channel
at the foot of Calais, where it is very narrow;
afterwards it grows broader on a sudden,
and ends between the Texel and the coast of
England at Norwich; at the Texel it forms a
small mediterranean sea, called <i>Zuyder-zee</i>,
and many other great canals, which are not
very deep.</p>

<p>After that the ocean forms a great gulph
called the German Ocean; it begins at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
northern point of Scotland, runs along the
eastern coast of Scotland and England as far
as Norwich, from thence to the Texel, along
the coasts of Holland and Germany, Jutland,
Norway, and above Bergen. This gulph might
be taken for a mediterranean sea, because the
Orkney islands partly shut up its opening,
and seem to be directed as if they were a continuation
of the mountains of Norway. It
forms a large strait, which begins at the
southern point of Norway, and continues very
broad to the Island of Zetland, where it narrows
all at once, and forms between the coasts
of Sweden, the islands of Denmark and Jutland,
four small straits; after which it widens to a
small gulph, the most projecting point of which
is at Lubec: from thence it continues pretty
broad to the southern extremity of Sweden,
when it grows broader and broader, and forms
the Baltic Sea, which is a mediterranean, extending
from south to north near 300 leagues,
comprehending the gulph of Bothnia, which is
in fact only a continuation of it. This sea has
two more gulphs, that of Livonia, whose most
projecting point is near Mittau and Riga, and
that of Finland, which is an arm of the Baltic,
extending between Livonia and Finland to Petersburgh,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and communicating with the lake
Ladoga, and even with the lake Onega, which
communicates by the river Onega to the White
Sea. All this extent of water, which forms the
Baltic Sea, the gulphs of Bothnia, Finland, and
Livonia, must be looked upon as one great
lake, supported by a great number of rivers
which it receives, as the Oder, the Vistula,
the Niemen, the Droine, in Germany and Poland;
other rivers in Livonia and Finland;
others still greater, which come from Lapland,
Tornea, the Calis, Lula, Pithea, Uma, and
many others that come from Sweden. These
rivers, which are very large, are more than 40,
including the rivers they receive, which cannot
fail of producing a quantity of water sufficient
to support the Baltic. Besides, this sea has no
flux nor reflux, although it is very narrow and
very salt. If we consider also the bearing of
the country, and the number of lakes and morasses
in Finland and Sweden, we shall be inclined
to look on it not as a sea, but as a great
lake formed by the abundance of waters from
the adjacent lands, and which has forced a passage
near Denmark into the ocean, where in
fact, according to the account of mariners, they
still continue to flow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>From the beginning of the gulph which forms
the German Sea, and which terminates above
Bergen, the ocean follows the coasts of
Norway, Swedish Lapland, North Lapland,
and Muscovy Lapland, at the eastern part of
which it forms a large strait, which borders
a mediterranean called the White Sea, which
may be likewise regarded as a great lake;
for it receives 12 or 13 rivers, all very considerable,
and which are more than sufficient
to support it; its water is but a little salt.
Besides, in many parts it is very near communicating
with the Baltic Sea; it has even
a real one with the gulph of Finland, for,
by ascending the river Onega, we come to
a lake of the same name; from this lake
Onega there are two rivers of communication
with the lake Ladoga; this last communicates
by a large arm with the gulph of Finland;
and there are many parts in Swedish
Lapland, the waters of which run almost indifferently
either into the White Sea, or the
gulphs of Bothnia and Finland; and all
this country being full of lakes and morasses,
the Baltic and White Seas seem to be the receptacles
of its waters, and which afterwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
discharge themselves into the Frozen and
German Sea.</p>

<p>Quitting the White Sea, and coasting the
island of Candenos and the northern coasts of
Russia, the ocean forms a small arm in the land
at the mouth of the river Petzora. This arm,
which is about 40 leagues long, by 8 or 10
broad, is rather a mass of water formed by the
river than a gulph of the sea, and also has but
little saltness. The land there forms a projecting
cape, terminated by the small islands of
Maurice and of Orange; and between this
promontory and the lands which border the
Strait of Waigat to the south, there is a small
gulph about 30 leagues depth inland. This
gulph belongs to the ocean, and is not formed
by the land waters. We afterwards meet with
Waigat's Strait, which is nearly under the
70th degree of north latitude. This strait is
not more than 8 or 10 leagues long, and communicates
with the sea which waters the northern
coasts of Siberia. As this strait is shut
up by the ice the greatest part of the year, it is
very difficult to get into the sea beyond it.
The passage has been attempted in vain by a
great number of navigators, and those who fortunately
passed it have left us no exact charts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
of that sea, which they have termed the Pacific
Ocean. All that appears by the most recent
charts, and by Senex's globe of 1739, is, that
this sea might be entirely mediterranean, and not
communicating with the great sea of Tartary,
for it appears to be enclosed and bounded on
the south by the country of the Samoides,
which is at present well known, and which
extends from the Straits of Waigat to the river
Jenisca; on the east it is bounded by Jelmorland,
on the west by Nova Zembla; and although
we are not acquainted with the extent
of this sea to the north and north-east, yet as
there does not appear any interruption of the
lands, there is great probability of its being
only a mediterranean, and bounded by land on
that side: what indeed proves this is, that by
leaving Waigat's Strait you may coast Nova-Zembla
all along its western and northern
coasts as far as Cape Desire; that after having
past this cape, keeping along the coast to the
east of Nova Zembla, you arrive at a small
gulph, which is about the 75th country of
Jelmorland was discovered in 1664, which is
only a few leagues distant from Nova Zembla,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
so that the only land which has not yet been
discovered is a small spot near this little gulph;
and this part is perhaps not thirty leagues long;
so that if the Pacific Sea communicated with
the ocean it must be at this little gulph, which
is the only way by which they can join; and as
this small gulph is in the 75th degree, even if
the communication should exist, we must always
keep five degrees towards the north to
gain the great sea. It is evident, therefore,
that if we would acquire the northern route to
China, it would be much better to pass by the
north of Nova Zembla, at the 77th or 78th degree,
where the sea is more open, and has less
ice, than to attempt the road through the icy
strait of Waigat, with the uncertainty of getting
out of this sea, which there is so much reason
to believe mediterranean.</p>

<p>By following, therefore, the ocean along the
coasts of Nova Zembla and Jelmorland, these
lands are discoverable as far as the mouth of
Chotanga, which is about the 73d degree, beyond
which there is an unknown coast of about
200 leagues: we have only an account of them
from the Muscovites, who have travelled by
land into those climates; they state the country
to be uninterrupted, have marked out the rivers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
in their charts, and called the people <i>populi palati</i>.
This interval of coasts, still unknown, extends
from the mouth of Chotanga to that of
Kauvoina, in the 66th degree of latitude; the
ocean there forms a bay, whose most projecting
point in land is at the mouth of the Len, which
is a very considerable river. This bay is very
open, belongs to the Tartarian sea, and is called
the Linchidolin, where the Muscovites have a
whale fishery.</p>

<p>From the mouth of the Len we may follow
the coasts of Tartary more than 500 leagues
towards the east, to a peninsula inhabited by
the Schelates. This is the most northern extremity
of Tartary, and is situate about the
72d degree of latitude. In this 500 leagues
the ocean makes no interruption by bays nor
arms, only a considerable elbow from the peninsula
of the Schelates to the mouth of the river
Korvinea. This point of land also forms the
eastern extremity of the old continent, and
whose western is at Cape North in Lapland;
so that the old continent has about 1700
leagues northern coasts, comprehending the
sinuosities of the bays, from Cape North in
Lapland to the farthest point of land belonging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
to the Schelates, and about 1100 leagues in a
straight line.</p>

<p>Let us now take a view of the eastern coasts
of the old continent, beginning at the farthest
point of land which the Schelates inhabit, and
descending towards the equator. The ocean
at first forms an elbow between the country of
the Schelates, and the land inhabited by the
people called Tschutschi, which projects a considerable
way into the sea. To the south of
this island it forms a small bay, called the Bay of
Suctoikret, and afterwards another smaller bay,
which projects like an arm 40 or 50 miles into
Kamtschatka; the ocean then enters into the
land by a long strait, filled with many small
Islands between the southern point of Kamtschatka
and the northern point of Jesso, and
forms a great mediterranean, which it is proper
we should now trace throughout. The first
is the sea of Kamtschatka, in which is a very
considerable island, called Amour, or Love
Island. This sea has an arm to the north-east;
but this arm, and the sea of Kamtschatka itself,
might possibly be, at least in part, formed by
the rivers, which run therein, from the lands of
Kamtschatka and from Tartary. Be this as it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
will, the sea of Kamtschatka communicates with
the sea of Corea, which makes the second part
of this mediterranean; and all this sea, which is
more than 600 leagues in length, is bounded
upon the west and north by Corea and Tartary,
and on the east and south by Kamtschatka,
Jesso, and Japan, without having any other
communication with the ocean than that of the
fore-mentioned strait, for it is not certain
whether that which is set down in some maps
between Japan and Jesso really exists; and even
if this strait does exist, the sea of Kamtschatka
and Corea will still be regarded as forming a
great mediterranean, divided from the ocean on
every side, and could not be taken for a bay, for
it has no direct communication with the ocean
by its southern strait, but with the sea of China,
which is rather a mediterranean than a gulph of
the ocean.</p>

<p>It has been observed in the preceding article,
that the sea has a constant motion from
east to west; and that consequently the great
Pacific Sea made continual efforts against the
eastern countries; an attentive inspection of
the globe will confirm the consequences which
we have drawn from this observation; for from
Kamtschatka to New Britain, discovered in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
1700 by Dampier, and which is the 4th or
5th degree in the south latitude, the ocean appears
to have washed away part of the land on
these coasts for upwards of 400 leagues, and
consequently the eastern bounds of the old continent
formerly extended much farther than at
present; for it is remarkable, that New Britain
and Kamtschatka, which are the most projecting
lands towards the east, are under the same meridian.
All countries have their greatest extent
from north to south. Kamtschatka reaches at
least 160 leagues from north to south, and that
point which is washed by the Pacific Sea on the
east, and on the other by the mediterranean sea
above mentioned, is divided in the direction,
from north to south by a chain of mountains.</p>

<p>After these the lands of Jesso and Japan form
another extent of land, whose direction is also
north and south, extending upwards of 400
leagues, between the Great Sea and that of
Corea. The chain of mountains of Jesso, and
of Japan, cannot fail of being directed from
north to south, since these lands, which are 400
leagues in this direction, are not more than 50
or 60 from east to west. Therefore the lands
of Kamtschatka, Jesso, and the eastern part of
Japan, must be regarded as contiguous, and directed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
from north to south. Still pursuing the
same direction, after having passed Cape Ava
at Japan, we meet with the island of Barnevelt,
and three other islands, which are placed in the
direction of north and south, and extend about
100 leagues. We afterwards meet with three
other islands, called the islands of Callanos, then
the Ladrones, which are fourteen or fifteen in
number, all placed in the same direction from
north to south, and all together occupying a space
of more than 300 leagues in this direction, by
so trifling a breadth, that its greatest does not
exceed seven or eight leagues from east to west.
It therefore appears to me that Kamtschatka,
Jesso, eastern Japan, the islands of Barnevelt,
the Callanos, and the Ladrones, are only the
same chain of mountains, and the remains of
an old country, which the ocean has at one
time covered and gradually retired from. All
these countries in fact appear to be only mountains,
and the islands to be their points or peaks,
while the low lands are covered with the ocean.
What is related in Lettres Edifiantes, appears,
to be true, and that in fact a quantity of islands
have been discovered, called the new Philippine
Islands, and that their position is really
such as is given by Father Gobien; and it cannot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
be doubted but that the most eastern of these
islands are a continuation of the chain of mountains
which forms the Ladrones, for these eleven
eastern islands are all placed in the same direction
from north to south, occupying a space of
more than 200 leagues in length, the broadest of
which is not more than 7 or 8 leagues from east
to west.</p>

<p>But if these conjectures are thought too presumptuous,
on account of the great intervals between
the islands bordering on Cape Ava, Japan,
and the Callanos, and between these islands
and the Ladrones, and between the Ladrones
and the new Philippines, the first of which is in
fact about 160 leagues, the second 50 or 60,
and the third near 120, I shall answer that the
chains of mountains often extend much farther
under the waters of the sea, and that these intervals
are small in comparison of the extent
of land which these mountains in the above
direction present, which is 1100 leagues, computing
them from the interior part of Kamtschatka.
In short, if we wholly reject this
idea, as to the quantity of land the ocean must
have gained on the eastern coasts of the continent,
and on that suit of mountains, still it
must be allowed that Kamtschatka, Jesso, Japan,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the islands Bonga, Tanaxima, those of Great
Lequeo, King's Island, Formosa, Vaif, Basha,
Babuyane, Lucca, Mindano, Gilolo, &amp;c. and
lastly, Guinea, which extends to New Britain,
and is situate under the same meridian as
Kamtschatka, do not form a continuation of
land of more than 2200 leagues, interrupted
only by small intervals, the greatest of which
perhaps is not more than 20 leagues, so that
the ocean has formed in the lands of the eastern
continent a great bay, which commences at
Kamtschatka and ends at New Britain. This
bay is interspersed with many islands, and has
every appearance of having been gained from
the land, consequently we may suppose, with
some probability, that the ocean, by its constant
motion from east to west, has by degrees
acquired this extent on the eastern continent,
and has formed mediterraneans, such as Kamtschatka,
Corea, China, and perhaps all the
Archipelago; for the earth and sea are there so
blended that it evidently appears to be an inundated
country, of which we only see the eminences
and high lands, while the lower are hid
under the waters of the ocean. This supposition
appears to be in some measure confirmed
by the water being more shallow than in other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
seas, and the innumerable islands resembling
the tops of mountains.</p>

<p>If we particularly examine these seas, we
shall find the sea of China forms a very deep
bay in its northern part, which commences at
the island of Fungma, and terminates at the
frontier of the province of Pekin, about 50
leagues distance from that capital of the Chinese
empire. This bay, in its most interior and
narrowest part, is called the Gulph of Changi.
It is very probable that this gulph, and a part of
the sea of China, have been formed by the
ocean, which has submerged all the ancient
country, of which only the islands before-mentioned
are now to be seen. In this southern part
are the bays of Tonquin and Siam, near which
is the peninsula of Malacco, formed by a long
chain of mountains, whose direction is from
north to south, and the Andaman islands, another
chain of mountains in the same direction,
and which appear to be only a succession of the
mountains of Sumatra.</p>

<p>The ocean afterwards forms the great Gulph
of Bengal, in which we may remark, that the
peninsula of Indus forms a concave curb towards
the east, nearly like the great bay of the
eastern continent, which seems to have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
also produced by the same motion of the ocean
from east to west. In this peninsula are the
mountains of Gates, which have a direction
from north to south, as far as Cape Comorin,
and the Island of Ceylon seems to have been
separated from this part of the continent. The
Maldiva islands are only another chain of mountains,
whose direction is also the same. After
these follows the Arabian Gulph, which sends
out four arms into the country; the two greatest
on the western side, and the two smallest on
the east. The first of these arms on the east
side is the Bay of Cambaia, which is not above
50 or 60 leagues in length: this receives
two very considerable rivers, viz. the Tapti
and the Baroche, which Pietro de Valle calls
the Mehi: the second arm, towards the east, is
famous for the velocity and height of its tides,
which are greater than in any other part of the
world, and which extends for more than 50
leagues. Many rivers fall into this gulph, as
the Indus, the Padar, &amp;c. which have brought
so great a quantity of earth and mud to their
mouths as to raise the bottom almost to a level,
the inclination of which is so gentle, that the
tide extends to a very great distance. The
first arm on the west side in the Persian Gulph,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
which spreads more than 250 leagues on the
land; and the second is the Red Sea, which
extends more than 680, computing it from the
island Socotora. These two arms should be
regarded as two mediterranean seas, taking
them from beyond the straits of Ormuz and
Babelmandel: they are both subject to the
tides, but this is occasioned by their being so
near the equator, where the motion of the tides
is much greater than in any other climate;
and besides they are both very long and narrow.
The motion of the tides is more rapid
in the Red Sea than in the Persian Gulph, because
the Red Sea is near three times longer
and quite as narrow. The Red Sea does
not receive any river whose motion might
oppose the tides, whereas the Persian Gulph
receives three very considerable ones in its most
projecting extremity. It appears very apparently
that the Red Sea has been formed by
an eruption of the ocean, for the bearing of
the lands are exactly similar, the coasts on each
side of the straits follow the same direction,,
and evidently appear to have been cut by
waters.</p>

<p>At the extremity of the Red Sea is that
famous neck of land called the Isthmus of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Suez, which forms a barrier to the Red Sea,
and prevents its communication with the Mediterranean.
In a preceding article we noticed
the reasons which inclined us to think that the
Red Sea is higher than the Mediterranean, and
that if the Isthmus of Suez was cut, an inundation
and an augmentation of the latter might
ensue. To which we shall subjoin, that if
even it should not be agreed that the Red Sea
is higher than the Mediterranean, it cannot
be denied that there is neither flux nor reflux
in the Mediterranean, adjoining to the mouths
of the Nile; and that, on the contrary, in the
Red Sea the tides are very considerable, and
raise the water several feet, which circumstance
alone would suffice to send a quantity of water
into the Mediterranean if the Isthmus was
broken. Besides, we have an example on this
subject quoted by Varenius, who says in page
100 of his Geography: "Oceanus Germanicus,
qui est Atlantici pars, inter Frisiam
&amp; Hollandium se effundens, efficit sinum,
qui et si parvis sit respectu celebrium sinum
maris, tamen &amp; ipse dicitur mare, alluitque
Hollandiæ emporium celeberrimum, Amstelodamum.
Non procul inde abest lacus
Harlemensis, qui etiam mare Harlemense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
dicitur. Hujus altitudo non est minor altitudine
sinus illius Belgici, quem diximus
&amp; mittit ramum ad urbem Leidam, ubi in
varias fossas divaricatur. Quoniam itaque
nec lacus his, neque sinus ille Hollandici
maris inundant adjacentes agros (de naturali
constitutione loquor, non ubi tempestatibus
urgentur, propter quas aggeres facti sunt)
pater inde, quod non sint altiores quam agri
Hollandiæ. At vero Oceanum Germanicum
esse altiorem quam terras hasce, experti sunt
Leidenses, cum suscepissent fossam seu alveum
ex urbe sua ad Oceani Germanici littora,
prope Cattorum vicum perducere (distantia
est duorum milliarum) ut, recepto per
alveum hunc mari, possent navigationem
instituere in Oceanum Germanicum, &amp;
hinc in varias terræ regiones. Verumenimvero
cum magnam jam alvei port em perfecissent,
desistere coacti sunt, quoniam turn
demum per observationem cognitem est,
Oceani Germanici aquam esse altiorem
quam agrum inter Leidam et litus Oceani
istius; unde locus ille, ubi fodere desierunt
dicitur, <i>Het malle Gat</i>. Oceanus itaque
Germanicus est aliquantum altior quam
sinus ille Hollandicus, &amp;c." Therefore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
as the German Sea is higher than that of Holland,
there is no reason why we should not
believe the Red Sea may be higher than the
Mediterranean. Herodotus and Diodorus
Siculus speak of a canal of communication
between the Nile, the Mediterranean, and the
Red Sea, and M. Del'isle published a map in
1704, in which he traces one end of a canal to
the most eastern part of the Nile, and which
he judges to be a part of that which formerly
joined the Nile with the Red Sea.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> See Mem. de l'Acad. Sciences, 1734.</p></div>

<p>In the third part of a book entitled, "Connoisance
de l'Ancien Monde, or the Knowledge
of the Old World," printed in 1707, we meet
with the like sentiment; and it is there said,
from Diodorus Siculus, that it was Neco,
King of Egypt, who began this canal, that
Darius, King of Persia, continued it, and that
it was finished by Ptolemy II. who conducted
it as far as the city Arsinoe, and that it could be
opened and shut when they found it needful.
Without desiring to deny these circumstances,
I must own, that to me they appear doubtful.
I do not know whether the violence and height
of the tide in the Red Sea, would not be necessarily
communicated to this canal; it appears to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
me, at least, that it would have required great
precautions to confine the waters, to avoid inundations
and to preserve this canal in good
repair. Though historians assert that this
canal was undertaken and finished, yet they do
not tell us the length of its duration; and the
remains which are pretended to be even now
perceptible, are perhaps all that was ever done
of it. The name of the Red Sea has been
given to this arm of the ocean, because it has
the appearance of that colour in every part
where corals, or madrepores, are met with at the
bottom. In the Histoire General des Voyages,
vol. i. pages 198 and 199, it is said, "Before
he quitted the Red Sea, D. Jean examined
what might have been the reason why that name
was given to it by the ancients, and if, in fact,
this sea differed from others in its colour. He
knew that Pliny had given several opinions on
the origin of this name. Some derived it from
a King named Erythros, who reigned in those
parts, and which, in the Greek language, signifies
red. Others imagined that the reflection
of the sun produces a reddish colour on the
surface of the water, and others that the water
was naturally red. The Portuguese, who
had made several voyages to the entrance of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
straits, asserted that all the coasts of Arabia were
very red, and that the sand and dust which the
wind carries into the sea, tinged the water of the
same colour.</p>

<p>"D. Jean, who examined the nature of the
water, and the qualities of the coasts as far as
Suez, asserts, that far from being naturally red,
the water is of the same colour as in other seas,
and that the sand and the dust having nothing
red in themselves could not give this tinge to
the water. The earth of both countries, he
says, is generally brown; it is even black in
some places, and in others white. On the coasts
of Suaquem, where the Portuguese had not
penetrated, he saw three mountains streaked
with red, but they were of a very hard rock,
and the neighbouring country was of the common
colour.</p>

<p>"The truth is, that this sea is throughout
of an uniform colour, which is easy to be demonstrated;
but it must also be owned, that in
some parts it appears to be red through chance,
and in others green and white; the explanation
of which phenomena is as follows: From
Suaquem to Kossir, that is, for the space of 136
leagues, the sea is filled with shoals and rocks
of coral; this name is given to them, by reason
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
that their form and colour render them so extremely
like coral, that it requires great circumspection
not to be deceived. There are
two sorts of them, the one white and the other
red; in many parts they are covered with a kind
of gum, or glue, of a green, and in others with
a deep orange. Now the water of this sea is so
transparent that the bottom may be seen at 20
fathoms deep, especially from Suaquem to the
extremity of the gulph; it appears, therefore,
to take the colour of the matters it covers; as
for example, when the rocks are covered with
a green gum, the water above appears of a
deeper green than the rocks themselves; and
when the bottom is only sand, the water appears
white: so likewise when the rocks are coral,
the water seems to be tinged with red; and as
these last coloured rocks are more frequently
met with there than any other, D. Jean concludes,
that the name of the Red Sea was affixed
to the Arabian Gulph in preference to the Green
or White. He applauds himself on this discovery,
because the method by which he ascertained
it left him no room for doubt. He caused a
float to be moored against the rocks in the
parts which were not deep enough to permit
vessels to approach them, and the sailors could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
often execute his orders with facility, without
the sea being higher than the stomach at more
than half a league from the rocks. The greatest
part of the stones and pebbles they drew up, in
those parts where the water appeared red, was
also of that colour: in the water which appeared
green, the stones were green, and if the water
appeared white, the bottom was white sand,
without any other mixture."</p>

<p>The direction of the coast of the Red Sea,
from Cape Gordafu to the Cape of Good Hope,
is pretty equal; in the course of which there
are no bays, excepting an arm on the coast of
Melinda, that might be supposed as belonging
to a large one provided the island of Madagascar
joined the continent, which most probably was
formerly the case, notwithstanding it is now
divided by the straits of Mosambique. The
coast bears the same direction from the Cape of
Good Hope to Cape Negro on the west side of
Africa; it has the appearance of being a chain
of high mountains, extends about 500 leagues,
but contains scarcely any rivers of importance.
Beyond Cape Negro however the land is much
lower, and is supplied by several considerable
rivers beside the Coanza and the Zaire; and
between that and Cape Gonsalvez, which is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
computed to be about 420 leagues, there are
the mouths of no less than twenty-four large
rivers; from this last Cape to Cape Trois-pointes
it is an open bay, in about the centre of
which is a considerable projection called Cape
Formosa. On the southern side are the islands
Fernanda, St. Thomas, and the Prince's Island,
and which there is reason to suspect are part of
a chain of mountains from Rio del Rey to the
river Jamoer. The water turns somewhat into
the land between Cape Trois-pointes to Cape
Palmas, from the latter of which it is an open
sea to Cape Tangrin; beyond this Cape there is
a small bay towards Sierra Leona, and another
in which are the islands of Bisagas. We then
come to a considerable projection into the ocean
called Cape Verd; of which the islands of that
name are supposed to be a continuation, although
it is more probable they are so of Cape Blanc,
which is both higher and extends farther into
the sea. From Cape Blanc to Cape Bajador is a
mountainous and hard coast to which the Canary
Islands seem to belong.</p>

<p>Turning from Africa we find an open bay
extending to Portugal, and in about the centre of
which are the straits of Gibraltar, through which
the water runs with great rapidity into the Mediterranean,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
which flows almost 900 leagues
into the interior part of land, and is the cause
of many curious circumstances; 1st, it has no
tides, at least that are visible, excepting in the
Gulph of Venice and what are almost imperceptible
at Marseilles and at Tripoli; 2dly, it surrounds
a number of extensive islands, for instance,
Sardinia, Sicily, Corsica, Cyprus, Majorca, and
Italy, which is the largest known. It has also
a fertile Archipelago; indeed it is from the Mediterranean
Archipelago, that all collections of
islands have been so denominated; this indeed
has the appearance of belonging more to the
Black Sea than the Mediterranean; nor is it in
the least unlikely that Greece was at one time
covered with the waters of the Black Sea, which
empties itself into the Marmora, and from
thence finds its way into the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Some have asserted there was a double current
in the Straits of Gibraltar, the one superior,
which carries the water of the ocean into the
Mediterranean, and the other inferior, which
carries them in the contrary direction; but
this opinion is evidently false, and contrary to
the laws of hydrostatics: it has likewise been
asserted to be the case in many other places, as
in the Bosphorus, the strait of Sund, &amp;c. and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Marsilli relates even experiments made in the
Bosphorus, to prove the truth of these opposite
currents; but the experiments must have been
badly made, since the matter is totally repugnant
to the nature and motions of the waters;
besides Greaves in his Pyramidography, page
101 and 102, proves, by able experiments, that
there is no such thing as a current in the Bosphorus,
whose direction is opposite to the superior:
what may have deceived Marsilli and
others, is possibly the circumstance, that in the
Bosphorus, the Straits of Gibraltar, and in all
rivers which flow with rapidity, there is a considerable
eddy along the shores, the direction
of which is generally contrary to the principal
current of the waters.</p>

<p>Let us now shortly trace all the coasts of the
new continent. Cape Hold-with-Hope, lying
in the 73d degree north latitude, is the most
northern land we are acquainted with in New
Greenland, and is not above 160 or 180 leagues
distant from Cape North in Lapland. From
this cape we may follow the coast of Greenland
as far as the polar circle, where the ocean forms
a broad strait between Iceland and Greenland.
It is pretended that this country, adjacent to
Iceland, is not the ancient Greenland which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the Danes formerly possessed as a province dependant
on their kingdom; for in that there
were civilized Christians, who had bishops,
churches, and several towns wherein they carried
on their commerce. The Danes also visited
it frequently, and as easily as the Spaniards
can go to the Canaries: there still exists, as it is
asserted, laws and ordinances for the government
of this province, and those not very ancient:
nevertheless, without attempting to divine
how this country became absolutely lost, it
is certain not the least trace of what we have
related is to be met with in New Greenland.
The people are wild and savage; there is no
vestiges of any edifice; nor have they a word in
their language which has an affinity with the
Danish; in short, there is nothing which might
give us room to judge that this is the same
country. It is even almost a desert, and surrounded
with ice for the greatest part of the
year. But as these lands are of a vast extent,
and as the coasts have been but little frequented
by modern navigators, they may have missed
the spot where the descendants of these polished
people inhabit; or the ice having become more
abundant in this sea, may prevent any approach
to the shore near them: nevertheless, if we can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
rely on maps, this whole country has been
coasted, and according to them it forms nearly
a peninsula, and at the extremity of which are
the two straits of Forbishers and of Friesland,
where it is extremely cold, although they are
not higher than the Orkneys, that is, at 60
degrees.</p>

<p>Between the west coast of Greenland and
that of Labrador, the ocean forms a gulph, and
afterwards a large mediterranean, which is the
coldest of all seas, and the coasts of which are
pot perfectly known. By following this tract
due north, we come to Davis's Strait, which
leads to the Christian Sea, and is terminated by
Baffin's Bay, which has the appearance of forming
a kind of road into Hudson's Bay. Cumberland
Strait, which as well as Davis's may
lead to the Christian Sea, is narrower and more
liable to be frozen: that of Hudson, though
much more to the south, is also frozen during
one part of the year. A very strong motion of
the tide has been remarked in these straits, which
is quite contrary to what is the case in the inland
seas of Europe, as neither the Baltic nor Mediterranean
have any; this difference seems to
arise from the sea's motion, which always moving
from east to west, occasions high, tides in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the Straits, whose openings are turned towards
the east; whereas in those of Europe, which
open to the west, there is no motion; the ocean
by its general motion enters into the first, and
avoids the last; and this is the reason that there
are such violent tides in the seas of China, Corea,
and Kamtschatka.</p>

<p>Proceeding from Hudson's Strait towards Labrador,
we come to a narrow opening, in which
Davis, in 1586, sailed as far up as 30 leagues,
and trafficked with the inhabitants, but no one
has since attempted a discovery of this arm of
the sea, and we are only acquainted with the
country of the Esquimaux of all the adjacent
land. The fort Pon Chartrin is the only and
the most northern habitation of this country,
which is separated from the island of Newfoundland
by the little strait of Belleisle, which
is not much frequented. As the eastern coast
of Newfoundland is in the same direction as
the coast of Labrador, we must regard the latter
as a part of the continent, the same as Isle-royal
appears to have been a part of Arcadia.
There is no very considerable depth either on
the great or other banks, where they fish for
the cod; but as they slant for a distance under
water, very violent currents are produced.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Between Cape Breton and Newfoundland is a
very broad Strait, by which we enter a small
mediterranean, called the Gulph of St. Lawrence.
This sea has an arm which extends far
into the country, and seems to be only the
mouth of the river St. Lawrence. The motion
of the tides is extremely plain in this arm of
the sea, and even at Quebec, which projects
more into the country, the waters rise several
feet. On quitting the Gulph of Canada, and
following the coast of Arcadia, we meet with a
small gulph called Boston-Bay, which forms a
small square inlet into the land. But before
we trace this coast farther, it is just to remark,
that from Newfoundland to the most projecting
Antille island, even to Guiana, the ocean
forms a very great bay, which reaches as far as
Florida, at least 500 leagues. This bay of
the new continent is similar to that of the old,
of which we have taken notice, where the
ocean, after having made a gulph between
Kamtschatka and New Britain, afterwards
forms a vast mediterranean, which comprehends
the seas of Kamtschatka, Corea, China,
&amp;c. so that in the new continent the ocean,
after having formed a great gulph between
Newfoundland and Guiana, forms a very large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
mediterranean, extending from the Antilles to
Mexico, which confirms our observations on
the motion of the sea from east to west, for it
appears that the ocean has equally gained on
the eastern coasts of America and Asia. These
great gulphs in the two continents are under
the same degrees of latitude, and nearly of the
same extent.</p>

<p>If we examine the position of the Antilles,
beginning at Trinidad, which is the most
south, we cannot doubt but that Tobago, Trinidad,
the Grenades, St. Vincent, Martinico,
Mary Galante, Antigua, and Barbadoes, with
every other island adjacent, at one time formed
a chain of mountains, whose direction was
from south to north, like that of the island of
Newfoundland, and the country of the Esquimaux;
afterwards the direction of the Antilles
is from east to west, beginning at Barbadoes,
then passing by St. Bartholomew, Porto Rico,
St. Domingo, and Cuba, and nearly the same as
Cape Breton, Acadia, and New England. All
these islands are so adjacent to each other, that
they may be looked upon as an interrupted
tract of land, and as the summit of an overflown
country now possessed by the sea. Most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of them in fact are only points of mountains,
and the sea which surrounds them is a real mediterranean
where the motion of the flux and reflux
is scarcely more sensible than in our Mediterranean,
although the openings they present
to the ocean are directly opposite to the motion
of the waters from east to west, which must
contribute to elevate the tides in the gulph of
Mexico; but as this sea is very broad, the flux
and reflux communicated to it by the ocean,
dispersing over so large a space, becomes almost
insensible at the coast of Louisiana, and
many other places.</p>

<p>The old and new continent appear, therefore,
both to have been encroached upon by
the ocean in the same latitudes. Both have
a vast mediterranean and a great number of
islands, which are situated nearly in the same
latitudes; the only difference is, that the old
continent being much broader than the new,
there is in the western part of it a mediterranean,
of which nothing similar can be found
in the new; but it appears that all which has
happened to the eastern countries of the old
world has also happened to the eastern part of
the new, and that the greatest revolutions are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
nearly in the middle and towards their equators,
where the most violent motion of the ocean
is made.</p>

<p>The coasts of Guiana, comprehended between
the mouth of the river Oroonoko and
the Amazones, presents nothing remarkable,
but the latter, which is the broadest in the universe,
forms a considerable extent of water near
Coropa, before it arrives at the sea, by the two
different mouths which surround the island of
Caviana. From the mouth of the Amazones to
Cape St. Roche, the coast runs almost straight
east; from Cape St. Roche to St. Augustine
it runs south, and from Cape St. Augustine to
the Bay of All Saints it turns towards the
west, so that this part of Brazil forms a considerable
projection in the sea, which directly
faces a like projection of land in Africa. The
Bay of All Saints is a small arm of the ocean,
running about 50 leagues into the land, and is
much frequented by navigators. From this
bay to Cape St. Thomas the coast runs direct
south, and afterwards in a south-west direction
as far as the mouth of the Plata, where the sea
forms an arm projecting nearly 100 leagues
into land. From thence to the extremity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
America, the ocean forms a great gulph, terminated
by the adjacent lands of Terra del
Fuega, as Falkland Island, Cape Assumption,
and the land discovered in 1671. At the bottom
of this bay is the Straits of Magellan,
which is the longest in the world, and where
the tides flow extremely high. Beyond Magellan
is that of La Maire, which is shorter,
and at last Cape Horn, which is the south point
of America.</p>

<p>We must remark on the subject of these
points that they all face the south, and most
of them cut by straits which run from east to
west; the first is that of South America, which
faces the southern pole, and is cut by the Strait
of Magellan; the second, that of Greenland,
which also directly faces the south, and is also
cut from east to west by Forbisher's Strait;
the third that of Africa, which also faces the
south; and beyond the Cape of Good Hope
are banks and shoals, that appear to have been
divided from it; the fourth, the peninsula of
India, which is cut by a strait that forms the
island of Ceylon, and facing the south like all
the rest. Hitherto we perceive no reason to be
given for this similarity, and can only remark
such are the facts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>From Terra del Fuega, all along the western
coast of South America, the ocean very considerably
penetrates into the land; and this coast
seems exactly to follow the direction of the
lofty mountains which cross all South America,
from south to north, from the equator to the
Arctic Pole. Near the equator the ocean
forms a considerable gulph, beginning at Cape
St. Francois, and reaching as far as Panama,
the famous isthmus, which, like that of Suez,
prevents the communication of the two seas,
and without which there would be an entire separation
of the old and new continents. From
thence to California there is nothing remarkable.
Between the latter and New Mexico
an arm branches off, called Vermilion Sea, at
least 200 leagues in length. In short, the
western coasts of California have been followed
to the 43d degree, at which latitude Drake,
who was the first that made the discovery of
the land to the north of California, and who
called it New Albion, was obliged, through
excessive cold, to change his course, and to anchor
in a small bay which bears his name, so
that these countries have not been discovered
beyond the 43d and 44th degree, any more than
the lands pf North America beyond Moozemlaki
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
under the 48th degree, and the Assiniboils
under the 51st. The country of the first
savages extends much more to the west than the
east. All beyond, throughout an extent of more
than 1000 leagues in length, and as many in
breadth, is unknown, excepting what the Russians
pretend to have discovered in their excursions
from Kamtschatka to the eastern part
of North America.</p>

<p>The ocean, therefore, surrounds the whole
earth without any interruption, and the tour of
the globe may be made from the south point of
America; but it is not yet known whether the
ocean surrounds the northern part of the globe
in the like manner; and all mariners who have
attempted to go from Europe to China by the
north-east of north-west have alike miscarried
in their enterprises.</p>

<p>The lakes differ from the mediterraneans;
the first do not receive any water from the
ocean; on the contrary, if they have communication
with the seas, they furnish them
with water. Thus the Black Sea, which some
geographers have regarded as an arm of the
Mediterranean, and consequently as an appendix
of the ocean, is only a lake, because, in
place of receiving water from the Mediterranean,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
it supplies it with some, and flows with
rapidity through the Bosphorus into the lake
called the Sea of Marmora, and from thence
through the Strait of the Dardanelles into the
Grecian Sea. The Black Sea is about 250
leagues long by 100 broad, and it receives
a great number of rivers, as the Danube, the
Nieper, the Don, the Boh, the Donjec, &amp;c.
The Don, which unites with the Donjec,
forms, before it arrives at the Black Sea, a
lake, called the Palus Meotis, which is more
than 100 leagues in length by 20 or 25 broad.
The sea of Marmora, which is below the Black
Sea, is a smaller lake than the Palus Meotis,
being not more than 50 leagues long and 8 or 9
broad.</p>

<p>Some ancients, and among the rest Diodorus
Siculus, have asserted that the Euxine, or Black
Sea, was formerly only a large river or lake,
and had no communication with the Grecian
sea; but being considerably increased with time
by the rivers which fell into it, the waters
forced a passage at first on the side of the
Cyanean islands, and afterwards on the side
of the Hellespont. This opinion appears to
be very probable, and the operation is easily
explained; for supposing the bottom of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Black Sea was formerly lower than it is at present,
then the rivers which come into it would
have raised it by the mud and sand which they
brought with them, until the surface of the
water became higher than the land, when consequently
it would have forced a passage for
itself, and as the rivers still continue to bring
sand and earth, and at the same time the quantity
of water diminishes in the rivers, in proportion
as the mountains from which they drew
their sources are lowered, it may happen in a
course of years that the Bosphorus will be
again filled up; but as these effects depend on
many causes, it is scarcely possible to give more
than mere conjectures thereon. From this
testimony of the ancients, Mr. Tournefort, in
his voyage to the Levant, says, on ancient
authority, that the Black Sea receiving the
waters of a great part of Europe and Asia, after
being considerably increased, opened itself a
passage by the Bosphorus, and afterwards
formed the Mediterranean, or so considerably
augmented it, that it became a great sea, and
forced itself a road through the strait of Gibraltar,
by which the island of Atlantis, mentioned
by Plato, was entirely overflowed.
This opinion has no foundation, since we are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
certain that it is the ocean which flows into
the Mediterranean, and not the Mediterranean
into the ocean. Besides, M. Tournefort has
not combined two essential facts, both of which
he mentions: the first is, that the Black Sea
receives nine or ten rivers, not one of which
but supplies it with more than the Bosphorus
throws out: and the second, that the Mediterranean
does not receive more water from
rivers than the Black Sea, although it is seven
or eight times larger, and that what the Bosphorus
supplies it with does not make the tenth
part of what falls into the Black Sea; how
then could this tenth part of what falls into a
small sea have formed not only a larger sea, but
have also so greatly increased the waters, as to
have broken down the lands at the strait of
Gibraltar, and overflow an island larger than
the whole of Europe? It is easy to perceive
that this passage of M. Tournefort has not
had due reflection. The Mediterranean receives
at least ten times more water from the
ocean than from the Black Sea, because the
Bosphorus is only 800 feet broad in its narrowest
part, whereas the strait of Gibraltar is
more than 5000, and that, even supposing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
their velocity to be equal, still the depth of the
straits of Gibraltar is by far the greatest.</p>

<p>M. de Tournefort, who ridicules Polybius
on his predicting that the Bosphorus would be
filled up in time, did not pay sufficient attention
to circumstances, when he asserted that event
to be impossible. This sea receives eight or
ten great rivers, and as most of them bring
sand and mud, must it not gradually be choaked
up? Must not the winds and the natural current
of the waters towards the Bosphorus,
convey thither a part of these matters? It is,
therefore, very probable that in a course of
time the Bosphorus will be filled, when the
waters of the rivers which come into the Black
Sea shall be gradually diminished; now all
rivers daily diminish, because the vapours collected
by the mountains being the first sources
of rivers, their quantity must decrease as the
mountains diminish in height.</p>

<p>The Black Sea in fact receives more water
from rivers than the Mediterranean, and the
same author observes, "the greatest rivers in
Europe fall into the Black Sea, by means of the
Danube, in which the rivers of Suabia, Franconia,
Bavaria, Austria, Hungary, Moravia,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Corinthia, Croatia, Bothnia, Servia, Transilvania,
Wallachia, empty themselves; those
of Black Russia and Podolia, go into the same
sea by the Niester; those of the southern and
eastern parts of Poland, of the northern parts
of Muscovy, and the country of the Cossacks,
enter therein by the Neiper or the Boristhenes;
the Tanais and Copa also fall into the Black
Sea by the Cimmerian Bosphorus; the rivers
of Mingrelia, of which Phasis is the principal,
also voids itself into the Black Sea, as does the
Casalmac, the Sangaris, and other rivers of
Asia Minor which have their course towards the
north; nevertheless the Thracian Bosphorus,
which is the only outlet from it, is not comparable
to any of these great rivers."</p>

<p>These facts prove, that evaporation alone
carries off a very considerable quantity of water,
and it is from this great evaporation from the
Mediterranean that the ocean continually flows
thither through the straits of Gibraltar. It is
difficult to estimate the quantity of water any
sea receives; we should be acquainted with the
breadth, depth, and rapidity of all the rivers
which enter therein, how much they increase
and diminish in the different seasons of the year,
and how much it loses by evaporation; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
last of which is most difficult; for even supposing
it proportional to the surfaces, it must be
more considerable in a hot than in a cold climate;
besides, water mixed with salt and
bitumen, evaporates more slowly than fresh
water; a troubled sea more quickly than one
that is tranquil; and the difference of depth has
also some effect: in short, so many circumstances
enter into this theory of evaporation
that it is scarcely possible to calculate any exact
estimations on it.</p>

<p>The water of the Black Sea appears to be
less clear and less saline than that of the ocean.
There are no islands in it, and its tempests
are more violent and more dangerous than in
the ocean, because the whole body of its waters
being contained in a bason, which has but a
small outlet, when they are agitated, they have
a kind of whirling motion which strikes the
vessels on every side with an insupportable violence.</p>

<p>Next to the Black Sea the greatest lake in
the universe is the Caspian Sea, whose extent
in length from north to south is about 300
leagues, and scarcely more than fifty broad.
This lake receives the Wolga and some other
considerable rivers, as the Kur, the Faie, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the Gempo; but what is singular, it does not
receive any on its eastern side; the country
on that side being only a desert of sand almost
unknown. Czar Peter I. sent some engineers
there to design a chart of the Caspian Sea, who
discovered that its figure was quite different
from that given by former geographers, who
had represented it to be round, whereas it is
very long and narrow. The eastern coasts of
this sea, as well as the neighbouring country,
were unknown: even the existence of lake
Aral, which is 100 leagues distant from it towards
the east, was doubtful, or at least thought
to be a part of the Caspian Sea, so that before
the discoveries of the Czar there was unknown
land in this climate upward of 300 leagues
long by 100 or 150 broad. Lake Aral is
nearly an oblong, and may be 90 or 100
leagues long, by 50 or 60 broad; it receives
two very considerable rivers, the Sideroias and
the Oxus, but as well as the Caspian has no
outlet for its waters; and it bears the further
resemblance, for as the Caspian receives no
river on the east, so lake Aral receives none on
the west, from which we may presume, that
formerly these two lakes were but one, and that
the rivers having, by degrees, diminished, left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
a great quantity of sand and mud, and which
forms the country that now divides them.
There are some small islands in the Caspian,
and its waters are much less saline than those of
the ocean; storms are here very dangerous, and
large vessels are not used in it for navigation,
because it has many sand banks, shoals and
rocks scattered under the surface of the water.
Pietro della Valle says, "The largest vessels
employed on the Caspian Sea, along the coasts
of Mazanda in Persia, where the town of Ferhabad
stands, although they are called ships,
appear smaller than our Tartanes. Their
sides are high, and they draw but little water,
having a flat bottom. They give this form to
their vessels, not only because this sea is shallow,
but because it is filled with shoals and sand
banks; so that if the vessels were not fabricated
in this manner they could not be used with
safety. Indeed, I was astonished, why at Ferhabad
they fish only for salmon, which are found
at the mouth of the river, some poor sturgeons,
and other sort of fresh water fish, of little value:
I attributed the cause of it to their ignorance of
the arts of fishing and navigation until the Cham
of Esterabad, whose residence is at a sea port,
informed me that the waters are so shallow 20
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and 30 leagues from shore that it was impossible
to cast the nets with the chance of taking
any fish, and that it was for this reason they gave
the above-mentioned form to their vessels, which
are not mounted with any cannon, as but few
corsairs and pirates ever visit this sea."</p>

<p>Struys and other travellers have asserted, that
in the neighbourhood of Kilan, there were two
gulphs wherein the rivers of the Caspian were
ingulphed, and carried afterwards by subterranean
canals into the Persian Gulph. De Fer
and other geographers have even marked out
these gulphs in their maps, nevertheless we are
assured by the people sent by the Czar that they
do not exist.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_B_2" id="Footnote_B_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> See Mem. Acad. Sciences, 1721.</p></div>

<p>The circumstance of willow leaves being
seen in great quantities on the Persian Gulph,
and which are supposed by the same authors to
come from the Caspian Sea because there are no
such trees on the Persian Gulph, is fully as improbable
as their subterraneous gulphs, and
which Gemelli Careri, as well as the Muscovites,
asserts are entirely imaginary: in fact,
the Caspian is near one third smaller than the
Black Sea, which last also receives much more
water by rivers than the former: the evaporation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
therefore is sufficient to carry off all its
water, nor is it necessary to suppose subterraneous
gulphs in the Caspian any more than in
the Black Sea.</p>

<p>There are lakes which do not receive any
rivers, and from which none go out. There
are others which both receive and discharge and
some that only receive them. The Caspian Sea,
lake Aral, and the Dead Sea, are of the last kind;
they receive the waters of many rivers, and contain
them. In Asia Minor there is a small lake
of the like kind, and one much larger in
Persia, on which the town of Marago stands;
its figure is oval, and it is about ten or twelve
leagues long, by six or seven broad; it receives
the river Tauris, which is not very considerable.
There is also a similar small lake in Greece,
about 12 or 15 leagues from Lepanto, which
are the only lakes of that kind known in
Asia. In Europe there is not one which is
considerable; in Africa there are many small
ones, as those which receive the rivers Ghir,
Zez, Touguedout, and Tasilet. These four
lakes are pretty near each other, and situate
towards the frontiers of Barbary near the deserts
of Zara; there is another situated in the country
of Kovar, which receives the river of Berdoa.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
In North America, where there are
more lakes than in any other part of the world,
not one of this kind is known, at least if we
except two small collections of water formed
by rivulets, the one near Guatimapo, and the
other some leagues from Realnuevo, both in
Mexico. But in South America, at Peru,
there are two contiguous lakes, one of which,
lake Titicaca, is very large, and receives a river
whose source is not very remote from Cusco,
and from which no river issues: there is one
smaller in Tucuman, which receives the river
Sala; and another larger in the same country,
which receives the river Santiago, and
three or four others between Tucuman and
Chili.</p>

<p>The lakes which receive no rivers, and from
which no rivers issue, are greater in number
than those just spoken of; these lakes are kinds
of pools where the rain water collects; or may
proceed from subterraneous waters, which issue
in form of springs, in low places, where they
cannot afterwards find any drain. The rivers
which overflow may likewise leave stagnate
waters in the country, which may remain for
a long time, and only be replenished by other
inundations. The sea has often inundated lands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and formed saline lakes therein, like that at
Haarlem, and many others in Holland, to which,
no other origin can be attributed; or by losing
its natural motion, might quit some land, and
leaving water in the lowest places may have
formed lakes, which have continued to be supported
by rains. In Europe there are many
small lakes of this kind, as in Ireland, Jutland,
Italy, in the country of the Grisons, Poland,
Muscovy, Finland, and in Greece. But all
these lakes are very inconsiderable. In Asia
there is one near the Euphrates, in the desert
of Irac, more than 15 leagues long: another
in Persia nearly of the same extent, and on
which the towns of Kelat, Tetuan, Vastan, and
Van, are situated; another small one in Chorazan
near Ferrior; another in Independent
Tartary, called Lake Levi; two in Muscovy
Tartary, another in Cochinchina, and one in
China very large, and not far distant from
Nankin; this last, nevertheless, communicates
with the adjacent sea, by a canal several leagues
in length. In Africa there is a small lake of
the same kind in the kingdom of Morocco;
another near Alexandria, which appears to
have been left by the sea; another very considerable
one formed by the rain in the desert
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Azarad, about the 30th degree latitude; this
lake is eight or ten leagues long; another
still larger on which the town of Gaoga is
situate, in the 27th degree; another much
smaller, near the town of Kanum, under the
30th degree; one near the mouth of the river
Gambia; many more in Congo, about the 2d
or 3d degree of south latitude; two more in
the country of the Caffrees, one called the
Lake Rufumbo, of no great length, and another
in the province of Arbuta, which is perhaps
the greatest lake of this kind, being about
25 leagues in length by seven or eight in
breadth; there is also one of these lakes at
Madagascar, near the east side, about the 29th
degree of south latitude.</p>

<p>In America there is one of these lakes in the
middle of the peninsula of Florida, in its centre
is an island called Serope; the lake of Mexico
is also of this kind, this is almost round,
and about 10 leagues diameter; there is another
still larger in New Spain, 25 leagues
distant from the coast of Campeachy Bay, and
another smaller in the same country near the
coast of the South Sea. Some travellers have
asserted that there was in the inland parts of
Guiana a very great lake of that kind; it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
called the Golden Lake, or Lake Parima.
They have related surprising things of the
riches of the neighbouring country, and of the
quantity of gold dust that is found in this lake.
They give it an extent of more than 400
leagues in length, and 125 in breadth. No
river, they say, goes out nor enters therein;
although many geographers have marked this
lake in their maps, it is not probable there is
any such existing.</p>

<p>But the most general and largest lakes are
those which receive and give rise to other great
rivers: as their number is very great I shall
speak only of the most considerable, or of the
most remarkable. Beginning at Europe, we
have in Switzerland the lake of Geneva, Constance,
&amp;c.; in Hungary, the lake Balaton; in
Lavonia, a large lake, and which separates this
province from Russia; in Finland, the lake
Lapwert, which is very long, and is divided
into many arms, and lake Oula, which is of a
round figure; in Muscovy, lake Ladoga, more
than 25 leagues long by above 12 broad. Lake
Onega is as long, but not so broad. Lakes
Ilmen and Belozo, from whence issue one of
the sources of the Wolga; the Iwan-Osero,
from whence issues one of the sources of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Don: two other lakes from whence the Vitzogda
derives its origin; in Lapland, the lake
from which issues the river Kimi; another
much larger near the coast of Wardhus, and
many others, from whence issue the rivers
Lula, Pithea, and Uma. These are not very
considerable. In Norway two more of nearly
the same size as those of Lapland: in Sweden,
lake Vener, which is as large a lake as Meler,
on which Stockholm is situated; and two others
less considerable; one is near Eveldal, and the
other near Lincopin.</p>

<p>In Siberia, in Muscovy, and in Independent
Tartary, there are a great number of these
lakes, the principal of which is the great lake
Baraba, which is more than 100 leagues long,
and whose waters fall into the Irtis; the great
lake Estraguel, the source of the same river:
many other smaller, the sources of the Jenisca;
the great lake Kita, the source of the Oby;
another larger, the source of the Angara; lake
Baical, which is more than 70 leagues long,
and is formed by the same river Angara; lake
Pehu, from which issues the river Urack, &amp;c.
In China and Chinese Tartary, lake Dalai,
from whence issues the large river Argus,
which falls into the river Amour; the lake of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the three mountains, the source of the river
Helum; the lakes Cinhal, Cokmor, and Sorama,
the sources of the river Honaho; two
other lakes adjacent to the river Nankin, &amp;c.
In Tonquin, lake Guadag, which is very considerable.
In India, the lake Chiamat, from
whence issues the river Laquia, adjacent to the
sources of the rivers Ava, Longenu, &amp;c. This
lake is more than 40 leagues broad by 50 long.
There is another at the origin of the Ganges;
and one bordering on Cashmere is the source of
the river Indus, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In Africa is lake Cavar, and two or three
others adjacent to the mouth of Senegal river.
Lakes Guarda and Sigismus make but one
lake, of a triangular form, about 100 leagues
long by 75 broad, and contain a very considerable
island. In this lake the Niger loses its
name, and takes that of Senegal, in the course
of which, towards the source, we meet with
another considerable lake, called Bournou,
where the Niger again loses its name, for the
river which comes therein is called Gambaru.
In Ethiopia, at the sources of the Nile, is the
great lake Gambia, upwards of 50 leagues
long. There are also many lakes on the coast
of Guinea, which appear to have been formed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
by the sea, and there are only a few lesser lakes
in the remaining part of Africa.</p>

<p>North America may be styled the country of
lakes; the greatest are lake Superior, upwards
of 125 leagues long by 50 broad; lake Huron,
upwards of 100 leagues long by 40
broad; lake Illionois, which, comprehending
the Bay of Puanto, is quite as extensive as
lake Huron; lakes Erio, and Ontario, together
upwards of 80 leagues long, from 20 to 25
broad; the lake Mistasin, to the north of
Quebec, is about 50 leagues in length; and
lake Champlain, to the south of it, is nearly
of the same extent; lake Alemipigon, and the
lake Christinaux, both to the north of lake
Superior, are also very considerable; the lake
Assiniboils contains many islands, and is upwards
of 75 leagues long; there are also, independent
of that of Mexico, two large lakes
in that country, the one called Nicaragua, in
the province of that name, which is upwards
of 70 leagues long.</p>

<p>In South America there is a small lake, the
source of the Maragnon, and another larger
which is the source of the river Paraguay; also
the lake Titicares, which falls into the river
Plata; two smaller lakes which flow into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
same river; and some others, not very considerable,
in the inland part of Chili.</p>

<p>All lakes from which rivers derive their origin,
those which fall into the course of rivers,
and which carry their water thereto, are not salt.
Almost all those, on the contrary, which receive
rivers without others issuing thereout, are salt;
this seems to favour the opinion that the saltness
of the sea arises from the salts which
rivers wash from the earth, and continually
convey into it; for evaporation cannot carry
off fixed salts, and consequently those which
rivers carry into the sea remain therein. Although
river water appears to taste fresh, we
well know that it contains a small quantity of
salt, and in course of time might have acquired
such a considerable degree, as to occasion
the present saltness of the sea, and which must
still continue increasing. It is thus, therefore,
as I imagine, that the Black Sea, the Caspian,
lake Aral, &amp;c. have become salt. With
respect to lakes, which do not receive any
river, nor from which does any issue, are either
fresh or salt, according to their different origins;
those near the sea are generally salt, and those
remote from it are fresh, because the one
has been formed by the inundations of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
sea, and the others proceed from springs of
fresh water.</p>

<p>The lakes any ways remarkable are the
Dead Sea, the waters of which contain much
more bitumen than salt: it is called the Bitumen
of Judea, but is no other than the Asphaltes,
which has caused some authors to call
it the Asphaltic Lake. The lands which border
this lake contain a great quantity of this
bitumen; and many have supposed, as the poets
feign of lake Avernus, that no fish could live
therein, and birds which attempted to fly over
it were suffocated; but neither of these lakes
produce such mortal events; fish live in both,
birds pass over them, and men bathe therein
without the least danger.</p>

<p>At Boleslaw, in Bohemia, there is said to be
a lake, wherein are holes, whose depth is unfathomable,
from which impetuous winds issue,
which are carried over all Bohemia, and
in winter raise pieces of ice of an 100 weight
in the air.</p>

<p>A petrified lake in Iceland is also mentioned;
and lake Neagh, in Ireland, has also the same
property; but these petrifactions are no other
than incrustations, like those made by the water
of Arcueil.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="ARTICLE_XII" id="ARTICLE_XII">ARTICLE XII,</a></p>

<p class="caption3">OF THE FLUX AND REFLUX.</p>


<p>Water has but one natural motion;
like other fluids it always descends
from the higher into the lower places, unless obstructed
by some intervening obstacle. When
it reaches the lowest place it remains there
calm and motionless, at least without some foreign
causes which agitates and disturbs it. All the
waters of the ocean are collected in the lowest
parts of the surface of the earth, of course the
motions of the sea must proceed from external
causes, the principal of which is the flux and
reflux, which is alternatively made in a contrary
direction, and from which results a general
and continual motion in the sea from east
to west. These two motions have a constant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
and regular relation with the motions of the
moon. When the moon is new, or at the
full, this motion from east to west is more sensible,
as well as that of the tides, which upon
most shores ebb and flow every six hours and a
half: that it is always high tide whenever the
moon is at the meridian, whether above or below
the horizon of the place; and low tide
when the moon rises or sets. The motion of
the sea from east to west is constant and invariable,
because the ocean in its flux moves from
east to west, and impels towards the west a
great quantity of water, and the reflux seems
to be made in a contrary direction, by reason
of the small quantity of water then driven towards
the west; the flux, therefore, must rather
be regarded as a swelling, and the reflux
as a subsiding of the water, which instead of its
disturbing the motion from east to west, produces
and continually restores it, although in
fact it is stronger during the rise, and weaker
during the fall, from the above reason.</p>

<p>The principal circumstances of this motion
are, 1. That it is more sensible when the
moon is new, or at the full, than in the quadratures:
in spring and in autumn it is also
more violent than at any other time of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
year; and it is weaker in the solstices, which,
is occasioned by the combination of the attraction
of the moon and sun. 2. The wind
often alters the direction and quantity of this
motion, particularly that which constantly
blows from the same quarter. It is the same
with respect to large rivers which convey their
waters into the sea and produce a current
there, often extending several leagues, which is
strongest when the direction of the wind agrees
with the general motion. Of this we have
an example in the Pacific Ocean, where the
motion from east to west is constant and very
perceptible. 3. We must remark that when
one part of a fluid moves, the whole mass receives
the motion; now in the motion of the
tides a great part of the ocean moves in a very
sensible manner, and consequently the ocean
is agitated by this motion throughout its whole
extent.</p>

<p>Perfectly to comprehend this we must attend
to the nature of the power which produces
the tides. We have observed that the
moon acts upon the earth by a power called attraction
by some, and by others gravity: this
force penetrates through the globe, is exactly
proportioned to the quantity of matter, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
decreases as the square of the distance increases.
Let us next examine what must happen to the
waters when the moon is at the meridian of
any one place.&mdash;The surface of the waters
being immediately under the moon is then
nearer that planet than any other part of the
globe; hence this part of the sea must be
elevated towards the moon, by forming an
eminence, the summit of which must be opposite
to the moon's centre; for the formation
of this eminence the waters at the bottom, as
well as at the surface, contribute their share,
in proportion to the proximity they are in of
the moon, which acts upon them in the inverse
ratio of the squares of their distances:
thus the surface of that part of the sea is first
raised; the surface of the neighbouring parts
will be likewise elevated, but to a less height,
and the water at the bottom of all these parts
will be raised by the same cause; so that all
this part of the sea growing higher and forming
an eminence, it is necessary that the water
of the remote parts, and on which this force of
attraction does not act, proceeds with precipitation
to replace the waters which are thus
elevated and drawn towards the moon. This
is what produces the flux, or high tide, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
is more or less sensible on different coasts, and
which agitates the sea not only at its surface
but even to the greatest depths. The reflux,
or ebb, happens afterwards by the natural inclination
of the water, for when the moon no
longer uses its power, the water which was
raised by this foreign power retakes its level,
and returns to the shores and places it had
been forced to quit. When the moon passes
to the antipode, or opposite meridian, the same
effect ensues, though from a different cause,
In the first case the waters rise because they are
nearer the planet than any other parts of the
globe; and in the second it is from the contrary
reason, they rise because she is the most
remote from them; and this it is easily perceived
must produce the same effect, for the
waters of this part being less attracted than
those of the opposite hemisphere, they will
naturally recede and form an eminence, the
summit of which will answer to the point of
the least action that is directly opposite to the
moon's station, or where she was thirteen
hours before. When the moon arrives at the
horizon the tide is ebb, the sea is then in its
natural state, and the water in a direct equilibrium;
but when she is at the opposite meridian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
this equilibrium can no longer exist,
since the waters of the part opposite to the
moon being at the greatest distance possible
from her, they are less attracted than the remaining
part of the globe, and hence their relative
weight, which always retains them in an
equilibrium, impels them towards the opposite
point to the moon. Thus in the two cases,
when the moon is at the meridian of a place,
or at the opposite meridian, the water must be
raised nearly to the same height, and consequently
fall and rise, when the moon is at the
horizon either at her rising or setting. Thus
a motion, such as we have just mentioned,
necessarily disturbs the whole mass of the sea,
and agitates it throughout its whole extent and
depth; and if this motion appears insensible in
the open seas, it is nevertheless no less real;
but as the winds cannot ruffle the bottom in an
equal degree with the surface, the motion of
the tides is necessarily more regular there, although
directed alternately in the same manner
as at the top.</p>

<p>From this alternative motion of flux and
reflux there results, as already observed, a continual
motion of the sea from east to west, because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the moon, which produces the tides,
proceeds from east to west, and successively
acting in the same direction, the water follows
her course. This motion is most considerable
in all sraits; for example, at the straits of
Magellan the water rises nearly 20 feet, and
continues so for six hours, whereas the reflux
lasts only two<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>, and the water runs towards
the west. This evidently proves that the reflux
is not equal to the flux, and that from
both there results a motion towards the west,
much stronger in the time of the flux than in
that of the reflux. This is the reason that in
open seas, remote from land, the tides are only
felt by the general motion of the waters from
east to west.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_C_3" id="Footnote_C_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_C_3"><span class="label">[C]</span></a> See Narborough's Voyage.</p></div>

<p>The tides are stronger in the torrid zone
between the tropics than in the rest of the
ocean: they are also more sensible in places
which extend from east to west, in long and
narrow gulphs, and on the coasts where there and
isles and promontories. The greatest known
flux is at one of the mouths of the river Indus,
where the water rises thirty feet. It rises also
very remarkably near Malays, in the straits of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Sund, in the Red Sea, in Nelson's Bay, at the
mouth of the river St. Lawrence, on the coasts
of China, Japan, Banama, in the Gulph of
Bengal, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The motion of the sea from east to west is
more sensible in particular places. Mariners
have observed it in sailing from India to Madagascar
and Africa; it is also very perceptible
in the Pacific Sea, and between the Malaccas
and Brazil: but this motion is most violent in
the Straits; for example, the waters are carried
with such great force in that direction through
the Straits of Magellan that it is felt to a great
distance in the Atlantic; and it is supposed
that this caused Magellan to conjecture there
was a strait by which the two seas had a
communication. In the Manilla straits, and
in all the channels which divide the Maldivian
islands, the sea flows from east to west, as well
as in the Gulph of Mexico, between Cuba and
Jucatan. In the gulph of Paria this motion is
so violent that the strait is called the Dragon's
Mouth. In the Canadian and Tartarian Seas
it flows also with violence, as well as in the
Strait of Waigat, through which it conveys
enormous masses of ice into the northern seas
of Europe. The Pacific Ocean flows from east
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
to west, through the Straits of Java; the sea of
Japan flows towards China, the Indian Ocean
flows towards the west, through the Straits of
Java and other Indian islands; we cannot,
therefore, doubt that the sea has a constant and
general motion from east to west, and it is
certain the Atlantic flows towards America,
and that the Pacific Sea goes from it, as is
evident at Cape Current between Lima and
Panama.</p>

<p>In short, the alternatives of the flux and reflux
are regularly made in six hours and a half
on most coasts, though at different hours, according
to the climate and position of the
lands: thus the sea coasts are continually beaten
by the waves which at each time wash away
some small parts of their matters, which they
transport to a distance, and deposit at the bottom
of the sea; so likewise the waves convey,
and leave on the lower shores, shells, sands, &amp;c.
these by degrees form horizontal strata, which
accumulating, become downs and hills, exactly
similar to others, both as to form and internal
composition. From this constant action, the
sea naturally shuts itself out from the lowest
coasts, and gains upon the highest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>To give an idea of the efforts of a troubled
sea against coasts, I shall relate a fact which
has been affirmed to me by a creditable person,
and which I the readier gave credit to, having
seen something nearly similar. In the principal
islands of the Orkneys there are coasts composed
of rocks perpendicularly divided to the
surface of the sea, to the height of near 200
feet. The tides in this place rise very considerable,
as is common in all parts where there
are projecting lands and islands; but when the
wind is very strong, and the sea swells at the
same time, the motion is so great, and the
agitation so violent, that the water rises to the
summit of these rocks, and falls again in the
form of rain: it throws to this great height
gravel and stones from the foot of the rocks,
and some of them even broader than the hand.</p>

<p>In the port of Livourne, where the sea is
much more calm, I saw a tempest in December,
1731, wherein they were obliged to cut down
the masts of some vessels that had been forced
from their anchors by the wind, and driven into
the road. The sea swelled above the fortifications,
which were of a considerable height, and
as I was on one of the most projecting works,
I could not regain the town before I was wetted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
by the sea-water much more than I could
have been by the most plentiful rain.</p>

<p>These examples are sufficient to shew with
what violence the sea acts against some coasts.
This continual agitation destroys and diminishes
by degrees the land. The water carries away
all these matters, and deposits them as soon as
it arrives at a part where the troubled sea subsides
into a calm. In tempestuous weather
the water is foul, from the mixture of matters
detached from the shore and bottom of the sea,
which then casts on the coasts a number of
things that it brings from a distance, and which
are never met with but after storms; as ambergris
on the west of Ireland, and yellow amber
on those of Pomerania, cocoa-nuts on the
coasts of India, &amp;c. and sometimes pumice and
other singular stones. We can quote on this
occasion a circumstance related in the new
travels to the American Islands. "Being at
St. Domingo, says the author, among other
things they gave me some light stones, which
the sea brought to the coast when there had
been strong southerly winds; there was one
two feet and a half long by eighteen broad,
and one thick, which did not quite weigh five
pounds: they are as white as snow, much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
harder than pumice, of a fine consistency, having
no appearance of being porous, but when
thrown into water, rebounded like a ball thrown
on the ground, and it was with great difficulty
they could be forced under the water with the
hand." The stone must have been a very fine
and close-grained pumice, which had issued
from some volcano, and which the sea had
conveyed, as it transports ambergris, cocoa-nuts,
common pumice-stone, seeds of plants,
rushes, &amp;c. Observations of this kind have
been generally made on the coasts of Ireland
and Scotland. The sea by its general motion
from east to west must convey the productions
of our coast to those of America; and
it is by some irregular motions that the productions
of the East and West Indies, as well
as the northern climates, are brought upon our
shores. There is a great appearance that the
winds cause those effects; large spots have
often been observed in the high seas, far from
shore, covered with pumice-stones; they could
only come from the volcanoes in islands or on
the continent, and which the current had
transported to the middle of the seas. Before
the southern part of America was known, and
in the time when the India Sea was thought to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
have no communication with our ocean, appearances
of this kind afforded the first supposition
of it.</p>

<p>The alternative motion of the flux and reflux,
and the constant motion of the sea from
cast to west, presents different phenomena in
different climates, according to the bearing of
the land and the height of the coasts. There
are parts where the general motion from east to
west is not perceptible; there are others where
the sea has even a contrary motion, as on the
coast of Guinea. But these contrary motions
are occasioned by the winds, by the position
of the lands, by the waters of large rivers, and
by the disposition of the bottom of the sea;
all these causes produce currents which alter,
and often change the general motion in many
parts of the sea; but as the motion from east
to west is the greatest, most general and constant,
it must also produce the greatest effects, and
all taken together, the sea must gain ground
towards the west, and lose it towards the east;
although it may happen that on those coasts
where the west winds blow during the greatest
part of the year, as in France and England, the
sea may gain on the east, yet these particular
exceptions do not destroy the effect of the
general cause.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="ARTICLE_XIII" id="ARTICLE_XIII">ARTICLE XIII.</a></p>

<p class="caption3">OF THE INEQUALITIES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE
SEA, AND OF CURRENTS.</p>


<p>The coasts of the sea may be distinguished
into three kinds, 1st, the elevated coasts,
which are rocks and hard stones, generally
divided perpendicularly, and which rise sometimes
to the height of 7 or 800 feet. 2d, The
low coasts, some of which are almost level with
the surface of the water, and others rising with
a moderate elevation, often bounded by rocks
at the water's edge, forming shelves and
breakers, which render the approach to shore
very difficult and dangerous. 3dly, Downs,
which are coasts formed by sand which the sea
accumulates, or brought or deposited by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
rivers; these downs form hills more or less
elevated, according to the accumulated sand.</p>

<p>The coasts of Italy are bordered by several
sorts of marble and stone; these rocks appear
at a distance as so many pillars of marble perpendicularly
divided. The coasts of France
from Brest to Bourdeaux are almost surrounded
with rocks just at the water's edge, which occasion
dangerous breakers. The coasts of
England, Spain, and many others, are also
bordered with rocks and hard stone; excepting
some parts which are made use of for bays,
ports, and havens.</p>

<p>The depth of water along the coasts is in
proportion to their elevation. The inequalities
at the bottom of the sea near the coasts, correspond
also with the inequalities of the surface
of the ground along the shore. A celebrated
navigator has made the following observations
on this subject.</p>

<p>"I have constantly remarked, that where the
coasts are defended by steep rocks, the sea is
there very deep, and seldom affords a probability
of anchoring; and, on the contrary,
where the ground inclines from the coast to
the sea, however elevated it may be further
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
inland, the bottom is good there, and consequently
admits of anchorage.</p>

<p>"According to the declivity of land, as it
approaches the water's edge, so we generally
find our anchor ground, and either approach
or keep at a distance from shore agreeable to
the steepness of the land; for I never saw or
heard of a coast where the land is of a continual
height, without some vallies lying intermixed
with the high-lands; they are the subsiding
of low lands, and afford good anchoring,
the earth being lodged deep under water; for
this reason it is we find good harbours upon
coasts which abound with steep cliffs, because
the land has subsided between them. But
Where the declensions from the hills is not within
land but towards the main sea, as at Chili and
Peru, and the coasts are nearly perpendicular,
as in the countries running from the Andes, it
is very deep, and has scarcely any creeks or
harbours. The coasts of Gallicia, Portugal,
Newfoundland, the islands of Juan Fernando
and St. Helena, &amp;c. are somewhat similar to
those of Peru, yet good harbours are not so
scarce, as there is always good anchorage where
there are short ridges of land. In general the
land under water seems to be exactly proportioned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
to the rising of the contiguous part
above, and therefore, where the lands upon the
shores are steep, there is but little security for
ships, they being very easily driven from their
moorings; yet although steep cliffs denote this
disadvantage, they assure us of this benefit
also, that we can sail close to them with safety,
besides being able to see them at a considerable
distance; whereas low lands are frequently
not discovered until we are near, and always
experience the hazard of running aground.
This fact of good anchorage where the lands
on the coast are low, might be illustrated by
many instances in the bays of Campeachy,
Honduras, Panama; the coasts of Portobella,
Carthagena, Guinea, Callifornia, China, Coromandel,
&amp;c. but going into particulars would
be almost endless, as I very seldom found it
otherwise than that deep waters and high shores
went together, as well as low lands and shallow
seas."</p>

<p>The fact therefore of there being considerable
mountains, and other inequalities, at the bottom
of the sea is fully confirmed by the observations
of navigators. Divers also assure us, there
are smaller inequalities formed by rocks, and
that it is much the coldest in the vallies of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the sea. In general the depths in great seas,
as we have already observed, increase proportionably
to their distance from shore. By Mr.
Buache's chart of that part of the ocean between
the coasts of Africa and America, and
by the divisions he has given of the sea from
Cape Tagrin to Rio-Grande, there appears to
be similar inequalities in the ocean to those on
land. That the Albrolhos, where there are
some rocks at the surface of the water, are
only the tops of very large and lofty mountains,
of which Dolphin island is one of the
highest peaks. That the islands of Cape de
Verd are also the tops of mountains that there
are a great number of shoals in the sea, which
round the Albrolhos descends even to unknown
depths.</p>

<p>With respect to the quality of the different
soils which form the bottom of the sea, as we
must rely on divers and the plumb, we can say
nothing exact or precise concerning it; we
only know that there are parts covered with
mud to a considerable thickness, on which
anchors have no hold; in these parts probably
the mud of rivers are deposited. In other
parts are sands similar to those on land. In
others are shells, heaped up together, madrepores,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
corals, and other productions of insects,
which begin to unite and appear like stones;
in others are fragments of stones, gravel, and
often entire stones and marble. For example,
in the Maldivian islands the buildings are made
of a hard stone weighed up from several fathoms
under water. At Marseilles very good marble
is obtained from the bottom of the sea, which,
so far from wasting and spoiling stone and
marble, in our discourse on minerals, we shall
prove they are formed and preserved therein;
whereas the sun, earth, air, and rain water, corrupts
and destroys them.</p>

<p>The bottom of the sea must be composed of
the same matters as our habitable land, because
the very same substances are contained in the
one as the other; places are found at the bottom
of the sea, covered with shells, madrepores, and
other productions of sea matters, as we meet
with on earth an infinity of quarries and banks
of chalk and other matters replete with the
same sort of shells, madrepores, &amp;c. so that
in all respects the dry parts of the globe resemble
those covered by the water, both in
composition of matters, and inequalities of the
superfices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>It is to these inequalities at the bottom of
the sea, we must attribute the origin of currents,
for if the bottom was equal and level, there
would be no other current than the general motion
from east to west, and a few others which
might be caused by the action of the winds;
but a certain proof that most currents are
produced by the flux and reflux, and directed
by the inequalities at the bottom of the sea, is,
that they regularly follow the tides, and change
their direction at each ebb and flow. See
Pietra della Valle on the subject of the currents
of the gulph of Cambay, and the accounts of
all navigators, who unanimously assert that in
those parts where the flux and reflux of the sea
is the most violent, the currents are also most
rapid.</p>

<p>Therefore it cannot be doubted but that the
tides produce currents whose direction always
answers that of the opposite hills and all mountains
between which they flow. Currents produced
by winds, also follow the direction of
those hills which are under the water, seldom
running opposite to the wind which produces
them, any more than those which are occasioned
by the tides follow the direction of their original
cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>To give a clear idea of the productions of
currents, we shall first observe they are to be
met with in every sea; that some are rapid, and
others slow; that some are of great extent,
both in length and breadth, and others short
and narrow; that the same cause, whether the
wind or tides, which produces these currents,
frequently gives to each of them a velocity
and direction very different; that a north wind,
for example, which should give the water one
general motion towards the south, on the contrary,
produces a number of currents, separated
from each other, and very different both in extent
and direction; some flowing towards the
south, others south-east, and others south-west;
some are very rapid, others slow; some long
and broad, others short and narrow; in fact,
their motions are so various that we have no
idea left of their original cause. When a contrary
wind succeeds, all these currents take an
opposite course, and follow in a contrary direction,
precisely in the same manner as would be
the case upon land between two opposite and
adjacent hills, provided it was covered with
water, as is seen at the Maldiva and all the
islands of the Indian seas, where the currents
run, and the winds blow, for six months in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
contrary direction. The same remark has been
made on currents between shoals and sandbanks.
In general all currents, whether caused
by the motion of flux or reflux, or the action
by the wind; have the same extent and direction
throughout their whole course, yet differ from
each other in most respects, which can proceed
only from the inequalities of the hills, mountains,
and vallies, at the bottom of the sea, it
being certain that the current between two
islands follows the direction of the coasts; and
the same is observable between banks of sand,
shoals, &amp;c. we must, therefore, look on the
hills and mountains of the bottom of the sea
as banks which direct the current; and hence
a current is a river, the breadth of which is
determined by that of the valley through which
it flows: its rapidity depends on the force
which produces it, combined with the breadth,
of the interval through which it must pass: and
its direction is traced by the position of the hills
and inequalities between which it must take its
course.</p>

<p>We shall now give a reason for the singular
correspondence between the angles of mountains
and hills, which are to be met with in
every part of the world. We have already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
remarked that when a river, &amp;c. forms an
elbow, one of the borders forms on one side a
projection inland, and the other forms a point
from land, and that through all the sinuosities
of their course this correspondence is always
found. This fact is founded on the laws of
hydrostatics. It would be easy to demonstrate
the cause of this effect; but it is sufficient that
it is general and universally known, and that
all the world may be convinced of it by their
own eyes, that when the banks of a river
form a projection inland to the left hand, the
other shore forms a projection from land to the
right.</p>

<p>Hence the currents of the sea must be
looked upon as great rivers, subject to the
some laws as those on land, and will, like them,
form in the extent of their course many sinuosities,
whose projections or angles will correspond;
and as the banks of currents are hills
and mountains, above or below the surface of
the water, they will have given these eminences
the same form as is remarked on the shores of
rivers; therefore we must not be astonished
that our hills and mountains, which have been
formerly covered by the sea, and formed by the
sediments which the waters have left, should,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
by the motion of its currents, have taken this
regular figure, and all the angles are alternately
opposite; they have been the shores of the
currents or rivers of the sea, and have therefore
necessarily taken a figure and direction similar
to those of the shores of the rivers of the
earth.</p>

<p>This alone, independent of the other proofs
we have given, would be sufficient to evince
that the earth of our continent and islands have
been covered with waters of the ocean, and
doubtless throws great light upon the Theory
which I have endeavoured to prove well founded;
for it was not sufficient to have proved
that the strata of the earth were formed by the
sediments of the sea; that the mountains were
elevated by the successive accumulation of such
sediments; and that they were composed of
shells and other marine productions; but it required
also a reason why the angles of mountains
so exactly correspond; this could only be
done by an investigation into the real cause,
which had not hitherto been attempted, and
which, being united with the rest, forms a body
of proofs as complete as may be had in physics,
and establishes my Theory to be founded on
facts, independent of all hypothesis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>The principal currents of the ocean are
those observed in the Atlantic Sea, near Guinea.
They extend from Cape Verd to the Bay of
Fernandes. Their motion is from west to
east; that is contrary to the general motion of
the sea. These currents are so rapid that vessels
sail in two days from Moura to Rio de Benin,
a course of 150 leagues; but they require six
or seven weeks to return; nor would it be possible
to get out of these climates if advantage
was not taken of the tempestuous winds which
suddenly rise in them; but there are entire
seasons during which vessels cannot stir, the sea
being continually calm, excepting what arises
from the currents, which is always directed
towards the coasts, and never extend more
than 20 leagues from shore. Near Sumatra
there are rapid currents, which flow from south
to north, and which probably formed the gulph
at Malacca. There are also considerable currents
between Java and Magellan, the Cape
of Good Hope, and the island of Madagascar,
especially on the coast of Africa, between
Natal and the Cape. In the Pacific Sea, on
the coast of Peru, and the rest of America,
the sea moves from south to north, and a south
wind continually blowing there seems to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the cause. The like motion is observed on the
coasts of Brazil; from Cape St. Augustine to
the Antilles; from the mouth of the Manilla
strait to the Philippine islands; and in the port
of Kubuxiu at Japan<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_D_4" id="Footnote_D_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_D_4"><span class="label">[D]</span></a> See Varen. Geography, page 140.</p></div>

<p>There are violent currents in the sea adjacent
to the Maldivian islands; and between those
islands these currents flow, as already observed,
constantly for six months from east to west,
and during the other six months they follow
the direction of the monsoons, and it is probable
they are produced by those winds.</p>

<p>We speak here only of currents, whose extent
and rapidity are very considerable, for in
every sea there are an infinity of currents,
though of no great importance. The flux
and reflux, the winds, and all other causes
which agitate the waters, produce currents,
more or less perceptible, in different parts.
We have observed that the bottom of the
sea, like the surface of the earth, is overspread
with mountains intersected with inequalities
and divided by banks of sand. In all
mountainous places currents will be violent;
in all places where the bottom of the sea is
level they will be almost imperceptible; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
rapidity of the current will increase in proportion
to the obstacles the water meets with, or
rather to the contraction of the spaces through
which they incline to pass. Between two
chains of mountains the current will be so
much the stronger as the mountains are near.
It will be the same between two banks of sand,
or two neighbouring islands. It is also remarked
in the Indian ocean, which is divided with an
infinity of islands and banks, there are rapid
currents throughout, which render the navigation
of that sea dangerous.</p>

<p>It is not inequalities at the bottom of the
sea alone which form currents, but the coasts
themselves have a similar effect, as the water
is repelled at greater or lesser distances: this
repulsion of the waters is a kind of current which
circumstances can render continual and violent;
the oblique position of a coast, the vicinity of
a bay, or of some great river, a promontory;
in one word, every particular obstacle which
opposes the general motion, will always produce
a current. Now, as nothing is more
irregular than the bottom and borders of the
sea, we must cease from being surprised at the
great number of currents which every where
appear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>All currents have a determinate breadth,
which depends on that of the interval between
the two eminences which serves it for a bed.
The currents flow into the sea as rivers flow
on land, and they produce similar effects.
They form their bed, and give to eminences
corresponding angles. In one word, it is these
currents which hollowed our vallies, formed
our mountains, and gave to the surface of the
earth, when it was under water, the form it now
retains.</p>

<p>If any doubt of the correspondence of the
angles of mountains remains, I appeal to the
sight of every man who makes the observation.
Every traveller, with the smallest attention,
will perceive that the opposite sides of a hill
exactly correspond. Whenever the hills to the
right of the valley form a projection, those opposite
recede to the left. These hills have also
nearly the same elevation, and it is very rare to
see any great inequality of height in the two
hills separated by a valley. I can assert, that
the more I have looked on the circumference
and heights of hills, the more I have been convinced
of the correspondence of the angles,
and of the resemblance they have with the beds
and borders of rivers; and it is by reiterated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
observations on this surprising regularity and
resemblance that my first ideas of this Theory
of the Earth arose. Let us add to these observations
that of the parallel and horizontal
situation of the strata, that of the shells being
dispersed throughout the earth, and incorporated
in every matter; and it must be admitted, that
on a subject like this we cannot have a greater
degree of probability.</p>

<p class="caption3">OF REGULAR WINDS.</p>


<p>Nothing can appear more irregular
and variable than the force and direction
of winds in our climates; but there are countries
where this irregularity is not so great, and
others where the winds constantly blow in one
direction, and with almost the same degree of
strength.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Although the motion of the air depends on a
great number of causes, there are nevertheless
principal ones, of which it is difficult to estimate
the effects, because of the modifications
from secondary causes. The most powerful
cause is the heat of the sun, which produces
successively a considerable rarefaction in different
parts of the atmosphere, and gives rise to
an east wind that constantly blows between the
tropics, where rarefaction is the greatest.</p>

<p>The force of the sun's attraction, and even
that of the moon on the atmosphere, are inconsiderable
in comparison with that just mentioned;
it is true, this force produces in the air
a motion similar to that of the flux and reflux
in the sea, yet it must not be supposed that the
air, because it has a spring, and is 800 times
lighter than water, receives, by the action of the
moon, a more considerable motion than that
of the waters of the sea; for the distance of the
moon being the same, a sea of any fluid matter
will have nearly the same motion, because
the force which produces it penetrates the
matter, and is proportional to its quantity; thus
a sea of water, air, or quicksilver, would elevate
itself nearly to the same height, by the action
of the sun and moon; hence we see that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the influence of the planets in the atmosphere
is not considerable, and although it must cause
a slight motion of the air from east to west,
this motion is insensible in comparison with
that produced by the heat of the sun; but as
the rarefaction will be always greatest when the
sun is at the zenith, the current of air must
follow the sun, and form a constant wind from
east to west. This wind blows continually
over the sea in the torrid zone, and in most
parts of the land between the tropics; it is this
wind we feel at the sun's rising; and in general
the east winds are more frequent and impetuous
than the west; this general wind from
east to west extends even beyond the tropics,
and blows so constantly in the Pacific Sea, that
vessels which sail from Acapulco to the Philippines,
perform their voyage, which is more
than 2700 leagues, without any risque, and almost
without any need of directing their course.
In the Atlantic, between Africa and Brazil,
this wind is also constant: it is felt also between
the Philippines and Africa, but not in
so constant a manner, by reason of the islands,
and different obstacles that are met with in
that sea; for during the months of January,
February, March, and April, it blows between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the Mozambique coast and India, but during
the other months, it gives place to different
winds: and although this east wind is less felt
on the coasts than in the open sea, and still
less in the middle of continents than on the
coasts; nevertheless there are places where it
blows almost continually, as on the east coasts
of Brazil, on the coasts of Loango, in Africa,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>This east wind continually blowing under
the line, is the cause, that sailing from Europe
to America, the course of the vessel is directed
from the north to the south, along the coasts of
Spain and Africa, to within 20 degrees of the
equator, where this east wind is met with, which
carries them directly to the coasts of America.
The voyage from Acapulco to the Philippine
islands, is made in two months by the favour of
this east wind: but the return from them to
Acapulco is longer and more difficult. At 28
or 30 degrees on this coast from the line, the
western wind is nearly as constant, which is
the reason that vessels returning from the East
Indies to Europe, do not follow the same track
as in going; those from New Spain sail north
along the coasts till they arrive at the Havannah,
and from thence they continue northward,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
until they meet with the westerly winds which
carry them to the Azores and afterwards to
Spain. So likewise in the South Sea, those
which return from the Philippines, or China,
to Peru, or Mexico, sail north as far as Japan,
and navigate under that parallel to a certain
distance from California, from whence, coasting
along New Spain, they arrive at Acapulco.
These winds do not always blow from one point,
but in general from the south-east from April to
November, and from the north-east from November
to April.</p>

<p>The east wind, by its action, increases the
general motion of the sea from east to west;
it also produces currents which are constant,
some flowing from east to west, others from
west to east; and from the east to the south-west
or north-west, following the direction of the
eminencies and chains of mountains at the bottom
of the sea, the vallies that divide them
serving as channels to these currents. The
alternative winds which blow sometimes from
the east, and sometimes from the south, produce
also currents which change their direction at the
same time with these winds.</p>

<p>The winds which blow continually for some
months, are generally followed by contrary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
winds, and therefore mariners are obliged to
wait for that which is favourable to their voyage.
When these winds change, a calm or dangerous
tempest generally ensues, and which continues
for several days, sometimes a month, and has
been known for more than two.</p>

<p>These general winds caused by the rarefaction
of the atmosphere, are differently combined
and modified by different causes in different
climates. In that part of the Atlantic, under
the temperate zone, the north wind blows
almost constantly during the months of
October, November, December, and January,
which makes those months the most favourable
to embark from Europe to India, in order to
pass the line by the aid of these winds; and it
is known by experience, that ships which quit
Europe in the month of March frequently do
not arrive sooner at Brazil than those which
sail in the October following. The north
wind almost continually reigns during winter
in Nova Zembla, and other northern coasts.
The south wind blows during the month of
July at Cape de Verd, when the rainy season, or
winter of these climates sets in. At the Cape
of Good Hope the north-west wind blows
during the month of September. At Patna,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
in the East Indies, the north-west wind blows
during the months of November, December,
and January, and produces heavy rains; but
the east wind blows during the other nine
months. In the Indian ocean, between Africa
and India, as far as the Malacca islands, the
monsoons reign from east to west from January
to the beginning of June, the west winds begin
in the months of August or September; during
the interval of June and July, there are dreadful
tempests generally from the north winds; but
on the coasts these winds vary much more
than in the open sea.</p>

<p>In the kingdom of Guzarat, and on the
coasts of the neighbouring sea, the north
winds blow from March till September, and
during the other months south winds almost
always reign. The Dutch, to return from
Java, generally set sail in the month of January
or February, when they have the assistance
of an easterly wind which is felt as far as the
18th degree of South latitude; afterwards they
meet with the south winds which carry them to
St. Helena<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_E_5" id="Footnote_E_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_E_5"><span class="label">[E]</span></a> See Varen. Geography, gener. cap. 20.</p></div>

<p>There are regular winds produced by the
melting of snows, which the ancient Greeks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
have noticed. During summer a north-east
wind, and in winter one from the south-east,
were noticed in Greece, Thrace, Macedonia,
the Egean sea, and as far as Egypt and Africa;
the same kind of winds have been remarked
at Congo, at Guzarat, and at the extremity
of Africa, which are all produced by the melting
of the snows. The flux and reflux of the
sea also produce regular winds which remain
only a few hours, and in many places winds
are observed to blow from the land during
night, and from the sea during the day, as on
the coasts of New Spain, Congo, the Havannah,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The north winds are pretty regular in the
polar circles; but the nearer we approach the
equator, the weaker they become: a circumstance
equally common to the two poles.</p>

<p>In the Atlantic and Ethiopian ocean within
the tropics there is an east wind which blows
all the year without any considerable variation,
excepting some few small places, where it
changes according to circumstances and the
position of the coasts. First, near the coasts
of Africa, having passed the Canary islands,
about the 28th degree of north latitude, a fresh
wind blowing from the north-east or north-north-east,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
is sure to be met with; this wind
accompanies the vessels to the 10th degree of
the same latitude; about 100 leagues from the
coast of Guinea; where at the 4th degree north
latitude they meet with calms and tornadoes.
Secondly, in going to America by the Caribbee
islands, this wind is found to veer more and
more to the east, in proportion as they approach
the coast. Thirdly, the limits of these variable
winds in the Atlantic, are greater on the
American coasts than on those of Africa. A
south or south-west wind blows continually
all along the coast of Guinea for a space of 500
leagues from Sierra Leona to the island of St.
Thomas; the narrowest part of that sea is from
Guinea to Brazil, being not more than 500
leagues across. Nevertheless, ships which
sail from Guinea do not direct their course
straight to Brazil, especially when they sail in the
months of July and August, for the purpose
of taking advantage of the south-east winds
which reign at that time<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_F_6" id="Footnote_F_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_F_6"><span class="label">[F]</span></a> See Abridg. Phil. Tran. vol. II, page 129.</p></div>

<p>In the Mediterranean the east wind blows
from the land in the evening at the sun's setting,
and the west wind from the sea at its rising in
the morning. The south wind, which is commonly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
attended with rains, and which generally
blows at Paris, Burgundy and Champagne about
the beginning of November, gives place to mild
and temperate breezes that produce that fair
weather vulgarly called the summer of St.
Martin's.</p>

<p>Doctor Lister pretends that the east wind
that blows between the tropics all the year, is
produced by the vapour of the plant called
sea lentil, which is extremely plentiful in those
climates, and that the difference of the winds
on the land proceeds only from the different
disposition of the trees and forests; and he very
seriously gives this ridiculous imagination for a
cause of the wind, by saying, that at noon the
wind is strongest because the plants are hotter
and respire the most, and that it blows from east
to west, because all plants, somewhat like sun-flowers,
turn and respire with the sun.</p>

<p>Other authors have mentioned the motion
of the earth on its axis as the cause of this
wind: this opinion is specious; and every
person, even but little initiated in mechanics,
must comprehend, that no fluid which surrounds
the earth can have a particular motion from
the rotation of the globe; that the air can
have no other motion than that of the earth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
and that all turning together at one time, this
rotative motion must be as insensible in the
atmosphere, as it is on the surface of the
earth.</p>

<p>The principal cause of the winds, as we have
observed, is the heat of the sun; on this subject
we refer to Halley's Treatise in Phil. Trans.
All causes which occasion rarefaction or condensation
in the air will produce winds, whose
directions will be opposite to the places
where is the greatest rarefaction or condensation.</p>

<p>The pressure of the clouds, the exhalations
of the earth, the inflammation of meteors, &amp;c.
are causes which also produce considerable agitations
in the atmosphere. Each of these
causes combining in different manners, produces
different effects. It appears to me,
therefore, a vain attempt to assign a theory of
the winds, for which reason I shall limit myself
to the study of their history.</p>

<p>If we could have a course of observations
on the direction, power, and variation of the
wind in different climates; if this course of
observations was exact and extensive enough
for us to perceive the result of these vicissitudes
of the air in every country, we should arrive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
at that degree of knowledge, from which at
present we are very remote; but a short time
has passed since meteorological observations have
been made, and possibly much more will pass
before we know how to employ the results of
them, although they are the only means that
we have to arrive at some positive knowledge
on this subject.</p>

<p>On the sea the winds are more regular than
on land, because the sea is an open space, in
which nothing opposes their direction, while
on land mountains, forests, and towns, form
obstacles which change their course. Winds
reflected by the mountains are often as impetuous
as in their first direction: these winds
are very irregular, because their course depends
on the size, height, and situation of the mountains
which reflect them. The sea winds
blow with greater power than the land winds,
are not so variable, and last longer. Land
winds, however violent, have moments of remission,
and sometimes of quiet, but at sea their
currents are constant and continual, without
any interruption.</p>

<p>In general on the sea the east wind, and
those which come from the poles, are stronger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
than the west and those which proceed from
the equator. On the land the west and south
winds are more or less violent, according to the
situation of the climates. In spring and autumn
all winds are more violent than in summer
or winter, and for these reasons; first, in
spring and autumn are the highest tides, and
consequently the winds that these tides produce
are most violent at those seasons; secondly, the
motion which the action of the sun and moon
produce in the air is also greater in the season
of the equinoxes; thirdly, the melting of the
snows in spring, and the condensation of the
vapours that the sun raises during summer,
which refall in plentiful rains during autumn,
produce, or at least increase the wind; fourthly,
the change from heat to cold, or from cold to
heat, cannot be made without increasing and
diminishing consequently the volume of air,
which alone must produce very high winds.</p>

<p>Contrary currents are often observed in the
air; some clouds move in one direction, while
others, which are higher or lower, move in a
directly opposite one; but this contrariety of
motion does not remain, being commonly produced
by the resistance of some large clouds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
that force the wind into another course, but
which returns again as soon as the obstacle is
dissipated.</p>

<p>The winds are more violent in mountainous
places than in plains, and increase until we
reach the common height of the clouds, that is
to say, to about one quarter, or one third of a
league perpendicular height; beyond that height
the sky is generally serene, at least during the
summer, and the wind gradually diminishing.
It is even asserted to be quite insensible at the
summit of the highest mountains; but these
summits being covered with snow and ice, it
is natural to suppose that this region of air is
agitated by the wind when the snow falls, and
only during summer that the winds are not to
be perceived. In summer the light vapours
which are raised above the summit of these
mountains fall in the form of dew, whereas in
winter they condense and fall in snow or ice,
which in winter may raise considerable winds,
even at that height.</p>

<p>A current of air increases in velocity where
the space of its passage is straitened: the
same wind which was moderate in an open
plain becomes violent in passing through a
narrow passage in a mountain, or between two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
lofty buildings; and its most violent action is
at the top of these structures or mountains, for
air being compressed by these obstacles, its density
and mass becomes increased, and as the velocity
remains, the force or momentum of the
wind naturally becomes much stronger. This
is the cause that near a church or castle the
winds seem to be stronger than at a distance
from them. I have often remarked, that the
wind reflected from a lone building is more
violent than the direct wind which produced it.
This can only be occasioned by the impelled
air being compressed against the building, and
by that means adds to its force.</p>

<p>The density of the air being greatest at the
surface of the earth, we might be led to imagine
that the greatest action of the wind should be
there also; and I indeed think this is really the
case when the sky is serene; but when it is
covered with clouds, the most violent action of
the wind is at the height of these clouds, which
generally fall in rain or snow. The strength
of the wind, therefore, must be estimated, not
only by the velocity, but also by the density of
the air; for it will often happen that one wind,
which shall have no more velocity than another,
will, nevertheless, root up trees and overturn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
buildings, only from the air impelled by this
wind being denser; and this evinces the imperfection
of the machines invented to measure
the velocity of the wind.</p>

<p>Particular winds, whether direct or reflected,
are more violent than general ones. The interrupted
action of land-winds depends on the
compression of the air, which renders each
blast much more violent than if the wind
blowed uniformly. A strong continued wind
never occasions such disasters as the rage of
those produce which blow, as it were, by fits;
but we shall give examples thereof in the following
article.</p>

<p>We may consider the winds, and their directions,
under general points of view, from which
possibly we may derive useful instructions; for
example, we might divide the winds into
zones. The east wind, which extends to
about 25 or 30 degrees on each side the equator,
exerts its action round the globe in the
torrid zone; the north wind almost always as
constantly in the frigid zones. Therefore it
may be said that the east wind occupies the
torrid zone, the north wind the frigid zones,
and with respect to the temperate zone, the
winds which reign there are merely currents
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
of air produced by these two winds, whose
direction tends to the eastern points. With
respect to the westerly winds, which often
reign in the temperate zones, both in the Pacific
and Atlantic Oceans, they may be regarded
as winds reflected by the lands of Asia and America,
deriving their origin from the east and
north winds.</p>

<p>Although we have said that, generally speaking,
the east winds reign around the globe to
about 25 or 30 degrees on each side the equator,
it is nevertheless certain, that in some
parts they do not extend so far, and their direction
is not always from east to west, for on
this side the equator it is east-north-east, and
beyond the equator it is east-south-east, and
the further we remove from the equator the
more the direction is oblique. The equator is
the line under which the direction of the wind
from east to west is the most exact; for example,
in the Indian ocean, the general wind
from east to west scarcely extends beyond 15
degrees. Sailing from Goa to the Cape of
Good Hope this wind is not felt till we have
past the equator; but after arriving at the 12th
degree south latitude, it continues to the 28th
degree. In the sea which divides Africa from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
America there is an interval from the 4th degree
north latitude to the 10th or 11th degree
south, where this general wind is not perceivable;
but beyond the 10th or 11th degree it
reigns as far as the 30th.</p>

<p>There is also much exception with regard
to the trade winds, whose motion is alternative.
Some remain a longer or a shorter time, others
extend to greater or less distances; others are
more or less regular, and more or less violent.
Varenius speaks thus of a principal phenomena
of these winds. "In the ocean between
Africa and India, as far as the Malaccas, the
east winds begin to reign in January and last to
the beginning of June; in August or September
the west winds begin and continue during
three or four months. In the interval of these
monsoons, that is from the end of June to the
beginning of August, there is no wind on that
sea, but they have violent storms which come
from the north.</p>

<p>"These winds are subject to the greatest variations
near the land, for ships cannot depart
from the Malabar coast, nor other western
ports on the coasts of the peninsula of India,
to sail to Africa, Arabia, or Persia, but from
January to April or May; for from the end of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
May, and during the months of June, July, and
August, there are such violent tempests from the
north or north-east that ships are not able to
keep the sea. On the other side of this peninsula,
in the sea which bathes the Coromandel
coast, these tempests are not known.</p>

<p>"To sail from Java, Ceylon, and many other
places, to the Malacca islands, the month of
September is the most proper time, because the
west wind begins to blow in these parts; nevertheless,
at 15 degrees south of the equator, we
lose this west wind and meet with the general
winds, which blow south-east. To sail from
Cochin to Malacca they depart in March, because
the west winds begin to blow at that
time; therefore these westerly winds blow at
different times in different parts of the Indian
sea; and it is necessary to sail at different periods
in going from Java to the Malaccas, from
Cochin to Malacca, from Malacca to China,
and from China to Japan.</p>

<p>"At Banda, the west winds finish at the end
of March, calms reign during April, in May
the east winds begin again with great violence.
At Ceylon, the west winds begin about the
middle of March, and remain till the beginning
of October, when the east or rather north-east
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
wind returns. At Madagascar, from the
middle of April to the end of May, the north
and north-west winds are constant; but in February
and March, the east and south winds
reign. From Madagascar to the Cape of Good
Hope, the north and collateral winds blow
during March and April. In the Gulph of
Bengal, the south wind prevails after the 20th
of April, before which time the south-west or
north-west winds are predominant. The west
winds are also violent in the sea of China, in
June and July, which is likewise the most
suitable season to go from China to Japan;
but to return from Japan to China, February
and March are preferred, because the east or
north-east winds prevail.</p>

<p>"There are winds which may be regarded
as peculiar to certain coasts; for example, the
south wind is almost continually on the coasts of
Chili and Peru; it begins at the 46th degree
south latitude, and extends beyond Panama,
which renders the voyage from Lima to Panama
much easier performed than the return.
The west wind blows continually on the Magellanic
coasts, and in the straits of Le Maire.
The north and north-west winds almost continually
reign on the Malabar coast. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
north-west wind is very frequent on the coast
of Guinea. The westerly winds reign on the
coasts of Japan, in the months of November and
December."</p>

<p>The alternative, or periodical winds, which
we have just been speaking of, are sea winds;
but there are also land winds which are periodical,
and return either at a certain season,
or in certain days, or even at certain hours;
for example, on the Malabar coast, from September
to April a land wind blows from the
eastern side; it generally commences at midnight,
and finishes at noon, and is not felt beyond
12 or 15 leagues from the coast; and from
noon till midnight a gentle wind blows from
the west. On the coast of New Spain, in America,
and on that of Congo, in Africa, land
winds reign during the night, and sea winds
during the day. At Jamaica the winds blow
from all parts of the coast at once during the
night, and therefore vessels cannot go in, nor
depart from it with safety, but in the day time.</p>

<p>In winter the port of Cochin is not to be
entered, nor can any vessel quit it, because the
winds blow with such impetuosity, that ships
cannot remain at sea; and besides the west
winds, which blow with such fury, bring to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
the mouth of the river so great a quantity of
sand as prevents the possibility of ships of any
size from entering it during six months of the
year; but the east winds which blow during
the other six months repel these sands, and
render the entrance of the river free. At the
strait of Babelmandel there are south-east winds
which reign throughout the season, and are always
succeeded by north-east. At St. Domingo
there are two different winds which regularly
rise almost every day, the one a sea wind
proceeding from the east, and commences at 10
o'clock in the morning; the other a land wind
comes from the west, rises at six or seven o'clock
in the evening, and remains all night. There
are many other facts of this nature to be extracted
from travellers, the knowledge of which
might perhaps lead to a history of the winds,
which would be a useful work equally to navigation
and physics.</p>

<p class="caption3">OF IRREGULAR WINDS, HURRICANES, AND OTHER
PHENOMENA, CAUSED BY THE AGITATION OF
THE SEA AND AIR.</p></blockquote>


<p>The winds are more irregular on the land
than on the sea, and in high places than
in low. The mountains not only alter the
direction of winds, but even produce some
which are either constant or variable according
to different causes. The melting of snow
upon the summits of mountains, generally produces
constant winds, which sometimes remain
a considerable time; the vapours that are stopt
by mountains accumulate there, and produce
variable winds, very frequent in all climates:
and there are as many variations in the motions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
of air, as there are inequalities on the surface
of the earth. We can therefore give only examples,
and relate circumstances which are attested;
and as we are deficient in a course of
observations on the variation of winds, and
even of the seasons in different countries, we do
not pretend to explain all the causes of these
differences, but confine ourselves to those which
appear the most probable.</p>

<p>In straits, on all projecting coasts, at the
extremity of all promontories, peninsulas and
capes, and in all narrow bays, storms are frequent;
but without these there are some seas
much more tempestuous than others. The
Indian ocean, the Japan and the Magellan seas,
that of the African coast beyond the Canaries,
and on the other side towards the coast of
Natal and the Red Sea, are very liable to
storms. The Atlantic is more stormy than
the ocean, which from its tranquillity is called
the Pacific Sea; this sea, however, is not absolutely
tranquil, except between the tropics,
for the nearer we approach the poles, the more
we are subject to variable winds, whose
sudden changes are frequently the cause of
tempests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>All continents are subject to variable winds,
which often produce singular effects; in the
kingdom of Cassimir, which is surrounded by
the mountain of Caucasus, at the mountain
Pirepinjale, extraordinary and sudden changes
are experienced; we pass, in less than an hour's
travelling, from summer to winter; at this
place are two winds, a north and south, and
which, according to Bernier, we successively
feel in less than 200 feet distance from each
other; the position of this mountain must be
singular, and merit observation. In the peninsula
of India, which is crossed from north to
south by the mountains of Gate, it is winter on
one side, and summer on the other at the same
time. The like difference is met with on the
two sides of Rozalgate Cape in Arabia; the sea
to the north of the cape is perfectly tranquil,
while in the south violent tempests are experienced.
It is the same in the island of Ceylon;
winter and high winds are experienced in the
northern parts of the island, while in the southern
there is fine summer weather. This contrariety
of seasons at the same time not only happens
in many parts of the Indian continent, but
also in many islands; for example, at Cerem, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
long island in the vicinage of Amboyna, they
have winter in the northern part, and summer
at the same time in the southern, and the interval
that divides the two seasons is not above
three or four leagues.</p>

<p>In Egypt they have a south wind in summer,
so hot as to prevent respiration, and
raises such great quantities of sand, that the sky
seems covered with thick clouds; this sand is
so fine, and driven with such force, that it penetrates
even into the closest chests. When
these winds last many days they cause epidemical
diseases, which are often followed by a
great mortality. It seldom rains in Egypt,
nevertheless every year there are some days of
rain in the months of December, January, and
February. Thick mists are more frequent
there than rain, especially in the environs of
Cairo; these mists begin in November, and
continue all the winter; and during the whole
year there falls so plentiful a dew, even when
the sky is serene, that it might be taken for a
slight rain.</p>

<p>In Persia winter begins in November and
lasts till March: the cold is intense enough to
form ice: much snow falls on the mountains,
and often a little in the plains. From March
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
to May the winds blows with great violence,
and bring heat with them. From May to
September, the sky is serene, and the heat moderated
by fresh breezes, which rise every
evening and remain till morning. In autumn
they have violent winds, like those of the
spring; nevertheless, although these winds are
very violent they scarcely ever produce tempests
or hurricanes; but in summer there often
arises along the Persian Gulph a very dangerous
wind, called by the natives Samuel;
it is still hotter and more terrible than that of
Egypt. This wind is mortal, and acting like
an inflamed vapour, it suffocates every person
unfortunately enveloped within its vortex. In
summer there also rises a wind of the same kind
along the Red Sea, which suffocates men and
cattle, and which conveys so great a quantity of
sand that many persons conceive this sea will
in time be choaked up with what falls therein.
There are often clouds of sand in Arabia
which darken the air and form dangerous
whirlwinds. At Veru Cruz, when the hot
north winds blow, the houses of the town are
almost buried under the sand. In summer hot
winds rise also at Negapatam, in the peninsula
of India, likewise at Petapouli and Masulapatan.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
These burning winds, which destroy
people, are fortunately of short duration, but
they are very violent, and the greater swiftness
they come with the more dreadful are their
heats, whereas all other winds refresh so much
the more as their velocity is greater. This
difference proceeds from the degree of heat in
the air, for while the heat of the air is not so
great as that of the body of animals, the motion
of the air is refreshing; but if the heat of
the air exceeds that of the body, then its motion
heats and burns. At Goa the winter, or
rather the rainy and tempestuous season, is
May, June, and July, and without which rains
the heat would be perfectly unsupportable in
that country.</p>

<p>The Cape of Good Hope is famous for its
tempests, and the singular cloud which produces
them. This cloud appears at first like
a small round spot in the sky, called by the
sailors the Ox's Eye. Probably its appearing
so minute is owing to its exceeding great
height.</p>

<p>Of all travellers who have spoken of this
cloud, Kolbe appears to have the most examined
it with attention; his words are, "The
cloud seen on the mountains of the Table, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
of the Devil, or of the Wind, is composed, if I
am not deceived, of an infinity of small particles,
impelled first against the mountains of the
Cape towards the east, by the easterly wind
which blows during almost the whole year in the
torrid zone; these particles are stopt in their
course by these high mountains, and collect on
their eastern side; they then become visible and
form these assemblages of clouds, which being
incessantly driven by the east wind, rise to the
summit of these mountains; they do not long
remain there at rest, but being obliged to advance,
they ingulph themselves between the hills before
them, where they are bound and confined as in
a canal; the wind presses them from above, and
the opposite sides of the two mountains retain
them in a direct line: in advancing they arrive
at the foot of a mountain, where the country is
a little more open, they then expand, and become
again invisible; but they are shortly driven
against other mountains, by clouds which are
behind them, and thus proceed with much impetuosity,
until they arrive at the highest mountains
of the Cape, which are those of the Wind,
or Table, where they have to encounter a wind
blowing in an exact contrary direction; this
occasions a dreadful conflict, for the vapours
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
being impelled behind and repelled before,
produce horrible whirlwinds either on the high
mountains of the Table, or adjacent vallies.
When the north-west wind yields, the south-east
increases and continues to blow with more
or less violence for six months, it reinforces
itself while the cloud of the Ox's Eye is thick,
because the vapours collected behind press forward,
and it diminishes as soon as its thickness
is lessened, because there are fewer particles and
less pressure, and it is entirely lowered when
the Ox's Eye is no longer apparent, because no
new or not sufficient vapours any longer come
from the east.</p>

<p>"All the circumstances attending this phenomenon
lead to an hypothesis, which well explains
every part of them: First, behind the
mountain of the Table we remark a train of
light white mists, which commencing on the
eastern descent of this mountain, incline to the
sea, and occupy the mountains of Stone throughout
all their extent; I have often contemplated
this train, which according to my opinion was
caused by the rapid passage of the vapour above-mentioned,
from the mountains of Stone to that
of the Table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"Secondly, These vapours must be extremely
embarrassed in their road, by the frequent
shocks and counter shocks caused, not only by
the mountains, but also by the south and east
winds which reign at places circumjacent to
the Cape: I have already spoken of the two
mountains called Hanging Lip and Norvege,
situate on the points of False Bay; when the
particles which I conceive are impelled on these
mountains by the easterly winds, they are repelled
from them by the south, which carry
them on the neighbouring mountains; they are
stopt there and appear like clouds, which is
often the case upon the mountains of False Bay.
These clouds are frequently very thick above
the land which the Dutch are in possession of,
on the mountains of Stenltenborch, of Drakenstein,
and Stone, but particularly on the mountains
of the Table, and of the Devil.</p>

<p>"In short, what confirms me in my opinion
is, that constantly two or three days before the
south-east wind blows on the Lion's Head,
small black clouds are perceived above it; these
clouds, according to my opinion, are composed
of the particles or vapours which I have spoken
of. If the north-west wind prevails when they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
arrive there, they are stopped in their course,
but are never driven to a great distance till the
south-east winds commence."</p>

<p>The first mariners who approached the Cape
of Good Hope were ignorant of the effects of
these clouds, which appear to form in the air so
slowly, and without any motion, but which in a
moment excite the most dreadful storms that
precipitate the largest vessels to the bottom of
the sea. In the country of Natal, a small cloud
similar to the Ox's Eye at the Cape, produces
the like effects. In the sea between Africa and
America, especially near the equator, these
kind of tempests very often arise. Near the
coast of Guinea, three or four of these storms
sometimes happen in a day; they are also caused
and announced by small black clouds; the rest
of the sky being generally serene, and the sea
perfectly calm. The first blast which issues
from these clouds is furious, and would sink
ships in open sea, if they did not take the precaution
to furl the sails. It is principally in
April, May, and June these tempests are experienced
on the coast of Guinea, because no
regular wind blows there. The stormy season
on the coasts of Loango is in January, February,
March, and April. On the other side of Africa,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
at Cape of Gardafu, these kinds of tempests rise
in May, and the clouds which produce them are
generally in the north like those of the Cape of
Good Hope.</p>

<p>All these tempests are produced by winds
which issue from a cloud, and which have directions
either from north to south, or north-east
to south-west, &amp;c. but there are other
kinds which are still more violent, and in
which the winds seem to proceed from every
quarter at once; they have a whirling motion,
which nothing can resist. A calm generally
precedes these horrible tempests; but in an
instant the fury of the winds raises the waves as
high as the clouds. There are parts of the
sea which cannot be approached, from there
being constantly calms and hurricanes in them.
The Spaniards have called these places Calms
and Tornados; the most considerable are near
Guinea, at two or three degrees north latitude;
they are 300 or 350 leagues in length by as
many in breadth, which forms a space of more
than 100,000 leagues square.</p>

<p>When contrary winds come all at once in
the same place, as to a centre, they produce
whirlwinds by the contrariety of their motions;
but when these winds meet with others in opposition,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
which counterbalance their action, they
then revolve in a considerable circle, and occasion
a dead calm, through which it is impossible
for vessels to make their way. These places of
the sea are marked in Senex's globes. I am
inclined to think that the contrariety of the
winds alone could not produce this effect if the
direction of the coasts, and the particular form of
the bottom of the sea, did not contribute thereto.
I imagine that the currents caused by the
winds, but directed by the form of the coasts
and the inequalities of the bottom of the sea,
end at these places, and that their opposite and
contrary direction, in a plain surrounded on all
sides by a chain of mountains, is the real cause
of these tornados.</p>

<p>Whirlpools appear to be no other than the
eddies of the water formed by the action of
two or more opposite currents. The Euripus,
so famous for the death of Aristotle, alternately
absorbs and rejects the water seven times in
twenty-four hours. This whirlpool is near
the Grecian coast. The Charybdis, which is
near the straits of Sicily, rejects and absorbs the
water thrice in twenty-four hours. We are
not quite certain as to the number of alternative
motions in these whirlpools. Doctor Placentia,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
in his treatise, says, that the Euripus has
irregular motions for eighteen or nineteen days
every month, and regular ones for the other
eleven; that in general it swells about one
foot, and seldom two: he says likewise that
authors do not agree as to the tides of the Euripus;
that some assert it is twice, some seven,
others fourteen times in twenty-four hours, but
that Loirius having examined it attentively, observed
it rose regularly every six hours, and
with so violent a motion, that it was sufficient to
turn the wheel of a mill.</p>

<p>The greatest known whirlpool is that in the
Norway sea, which is affirmed to be upwards
of twenty leagues in circumference. It absorbs
for six hours water, whales, ships, and every
thing that comes near it, and afterwards returns
them in the same quantity of time as it drew
them in.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to suppose there are holes
and abysses in the bottom of the sea which
swallow up the waters continually; to assign
a reason for whirlpools, it is well known that
when water has two contrary directions, the
combination of these motions produce a whirling,
and seem to form a void place in the
centre. It is the same with respect to whirlpools
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
in the sea, they are produced by two or
three contrary currents; and as the flux and
reflux, which run every six hours in contrary
directions, are the principal cause of currents,
it is not astonishing that whirlpools, which result
from them, attract and swallow up all that
surrounds them, and afterwards reject all they
have absorbed in the same portion of time.</p>

<p>Whirlpools, therefore, are produced by opposite
currents, and likewise by the meeting of
contrary winds. These whirlwinds are common
in the sea of China and Japan, near the
Antilles, and in many other parts of the sea,
particularly near projecting lands and high
coasts; but they are still more frequent upon
land, and their effects are sometimes prodigious.
"I have seen," says Bellarmin, "an
enormous ditch dug up by the wind, and the
earth thereof carried to a distance; so that
the place from whence it had been taken appeared
a frightful hole, and the village upon
which it was dropped was entirely buried
with it."</p>

<p>In the history of the French Academy, and
in the Philosophical Transactions, are the detail
of the effects of many hurricanes, which appear
inconceivable and scarcely credible, if the facts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
were not attested by a great number of intelligent
testimonies.</p>

<p>It is the same with respect to water-spouts,
which mariners never see without fear and
amazement; these are very frequent near certain
coasts of the Mediterranean, especially
when the sky is cloudy and the wind blows at
the same time from various coasts. They are
more common near the coasts of Laodicea,
Grecgo and Carmel, than in other parts of the
Mediterranean. Most of them are large cylinders
of water which fall from the clouds, although it
appears, when we are at some distance, that the
water of the sea rises up to the clouds.<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_G_7" id="Footnote_G_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_G_7"><span class="label">[G]</span></a> See Shaw's Travels, vol. 2. p. 56.</p></div>

<p>But there are two kinds of water-spouts, the
first of which, alluded to above, is no other
than a thick compressed cloud, reduced to a
small space by contrary winds, which, blowing
at the same time from many corners, give it a
cylindric form, and causes the water to fall by
its own weight. The quantity of water is so
great, and the fall so sudden and precipitate, that
if unfortunately one of these spouts breaks on a
vessel, it shatters it to pieces and sinks it in
an instant. It is asserted, and possibly with
foundation, that these spouts may be broken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and destroyed by the commotion which the
firing of cannons excites in the air; which answers
to the effect of dispersing thunder-clouds
by the ringing of bells.</p>

<p>The other kind of water-spout is called a
typhon, which many authors have confounded
with the hurricane, in speaking of the storms
of the Chinese sea, which is in fact subject to
both. The typhon does not descend from the
clouds, but rises up from the sea with great
violence. By whirlwinds, sands, earth, houses,
trees, and animals, are raised in the air, and
transported to different parts; but typhons, on
the contrary, remain in the same place, and can
only have subterraneous fires for their origin;
for the sea is then in the greatest agitation, and
the air so strongly filled with sulphurous exhalations,
that the sky appears covered with a
copper-coloured crust, although there are no
clouds, and the sun or stars may be seen
through the vapour. It is to these subterraneous
fires the warmth of the sea of China in
winter must be attributed, as these typhons

<p>Thevenot, in his voyage to the Levant, says,
"we saw water-spouts in the Persian gulph,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
between the islands Quesomo, Lareca, and
Ormutz. I think few people have considered
water-spouts with so much attention as I have
done. I shall mention my remarks with all
possible simplicity, in order to render them plain
and easy to be comprehended.</p>

<p>"The first that we saw appeared on the
northern coast, between us and the island
Quesomo, about a gun-shot from the ship:
we directly perceived the water boiled on the
surface of the sea, and was raised about a
foot: it was whitish, and the top appeared like
a thick black smoke, so that it properly resembled
some burning straw, which only
smoked. It made a noise like a torrent that
runs with rapidity into a deep valley. This
noise was mixed with another, similar to the
hissing of serpents: a little afterwards we perceived
something like a dark pipe, which resembled
smoke ascending towards the clouds,
turning round with great velocity: this appeared
about the thickness of my finger, and
the same noise still continued. After this it
disappeared, having remained somewhat less
than a quarter of an hour. This over, we
perceived another on the south side, which began
in the same manner as the preceding:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
directly after a third made its appearance on
the west, and then a fourth by its side. The
farthest of them was not more than a musket-shot
from us. They all appeared like burning
heaps of straw, a foot and a half or two feet
high, and were attended with the same noise as
the first. We afterwards saw three pipes or
canals descending from the clouds to the water.
They were broad at the top and lessened downwards,
something in the shape of a trumpet,
or as the paps of an animal, drawn perpendicularly
down by a heavy weight. These canals
appeared of a darkish white, occasioned, as I
think, by the waters which were in them; for
apparently they were formed before the water
entered, as when they were empty they were
no longer to be seen, like as a clear glass tube
placed at some distance before our eyes, is not
perceptible if it is not filled with some coloured
liquor. These pipes were not strait but crooked
in some places; they were not even perpendicular,
but from the clouds, where they were
joined, to the parts which drew in the water,
they were very much bent; and what is more
particular, the cloud, to which the second of
the three was fastened, having been driven by
the wind, this pipe followed it without breaking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
or quitting the place where it drew in the
water, and passing behind the first, they had
for some time the form of St. Andrew's cross.
At the beginning neither of them was more
than an inch in thickness, excepting just at the
top, but afterwards the first of the three increased
considerably. The two others scarcely
remained longer than that which we saw on
the north side. The second, on the south side,
remained about a quarter of an hour, but the
first on that side remained longer, and gave us
some apprehensions. At first it was not bigger
than my finger, afterwards it swelled as thick
as my arm, then as my leg, and at last as the
trunk of a large tree, which a man might encompass
with both his arms. We distinctly
perceived water through this transparent body,
which ascended in a serpentine manner. Sometimes
it diminished in size at the top, and
sometimes at the bottom, then it exactly resembled
a tube with some fluid matter pressed
with the fingers, either above to make this
liquor descend, or at bottom to cause it to ascend;
and I am persuaded that it was the
violence of the wind which caused these
changes, pressing the pipe in a similar manner.
After this it diminished less than my arm, then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
returned as large as my thigh, and then again
became very small; at last I saw the water that
was raised from the surface began to lower,
and the end of the pipe divided from it, when,
by the change of light from a cloud, it was lost
to our sight; I continued, however, to observe
whether it returned, because I had remarked
that the pipe of the second had appeared to be
broken in the middle, and directly after we saw
it whole. This we found was occasioned by
the light which hid the half from us, but the
last we saw no more.</p>

<p>"These water-spouts are very dangerous, for
if they fall on a vessel they entangle in the
sails so much that sometimes they raise it up,
and afterwards let it fall with such violence as
to sink it; at least if they do not lift the vessel
up, they tear all the sails, or let the water they
contain fall on it, and which often sinks it to
the bottom. There cannot be the least doubt
but it is by similar accidents that many ships,
of which we have heard no accounts, have
been lost, since there are but few examples
of those that we have known, from certainty,
to have perished in this manner."</p>

<p>I suspect there are many optical illusions in
the above account, but I have recounted them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
as related, in order that we might compare them
with those of other travellers. The following
description is by M. Gentil, in his voyage
round the world. "At eleven o'clock in the
morning, the air being filled with clouds, we
perceived about our vessel, at a quarter of a
mile distant, six water-spouts, which made a
noise similar to that of water flowing in subterraneous
canals, and increased until it resembled
the whistling which an impetuous wind
makes among the cordage of a ship. We at
first observed the water to boil up about a foot
and a half above the surface. Above this boiling
there appeared a mixed or rather a thick
smoke, which formed a kind of canal, that
ascended to the clouds. These canals inclined
according as the wind moved the clouds to which
they were attached, and in spite of the wind's
impulsion they not only adhered to them, but
even lengthened and shortened themselves in
proportion as the clouds rose higher or lower in
the atmosphere.</p>

<p>"These phenomena terrified us greatly, and
our sailors, instead of being bolder, fomented
their fears by the dismal tales they told each
other. If these spouts, said they, fall on our
vessel, they will lift her up, and then she will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
sink by the violence of her fall. Others contended
in a decisive tone, that they would not
raise the vessel up, but if they met it in their
course, being full of water, the ship would
break the communication they had with the sea,
and the whole body of the water would fall perpendicularly
on the deck of the vessel and split
her to pieces.</p>

<p>"To prevent this misfortune the cannon
was loaded, the sailors pretending the report of
a cannon, by agitating the air, dissipated these
phenomena; but we had no need of having recourse
to this remedy, for when they had run
about ten minutes about the ship, some at a
quarter of a league, others at a less distance,
we perceived the canals to grow narrower by
degrees, till they got loose from the surface of
the sea and then dissipated."</p>

<p>It appears from the description given by
these two travellers, that water-spouts are produced,
at least in part, by the action of a fire
or smoke which rises from the bottom of the
sea with great force, and that they are quite
different from those produced by contrary
winds.</p>

<p>"The water-spouts, says Mr. Shaw, which
I had an opportunity of seeing, appeared as so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
many cylinders of water, which fell from the
clouds, although by the reflection of the columns
which descend, or by the drops which
detach themselves from the water they contain,
it sometimes seems, especially when we are at
some distance, that the water is drawn up from
the sea. To render a reason for this phenomena
we may suppose that the clouds being
collected in one part by opposite winds, they
force them by pressing them with violence to
condense and descend in this manner."</p>

<p>There still remain many facts to be acquired
before we can give a complete explanation
of these phenomena; it appears to me, that
if there are under the waters of the sea, at
particular places, soils mixed with sulphur,
bitumen, and minerals, these matters may be
inflamed and produce a great quantity of air,
which being newly generated and prodigiously
rarefied, ascends with rapidity, and may raise
these water-spouts from the sea to the sky; so
likewise if, by inflammation, the sulphurous
matters which a cloud contains, a current of
air is formed, which descends perpendicularly
from the clouds towards the sea, all its water
may follow the current of air, and form a
water-spout which will fall from the sky upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the sea; but it must be allowed that the explanation
of this kind of water-spout, no more than
that we have given of those produced by contrary
winds, is not satisfactory; and it might
be asked why these kinds of water-spouts, which
fall perpendicularly from the clouds, are not as
often seen on the land as on the sea?</p>

<p>The History of the Academy, anno 1727,
mentions a land water-spout which appeared at
Capestan, near Beziers; it descended from a
cloud like a black pillar, which diminished by
degrees, and at length terminated in a point
upon the surface of the earth. It obeyed the
wind which blew from west to south-west.
It was accompanied with a very thick smoke,
and made a similar noise to that of a troubled
sea. It tore up and carried away trees to the
distance of forty or fifty feet, marking its way
by a large track, on which three carriages might
have passed each other. There appeared another
pillar of the same kind, but which soon joined
the first; and after the whole had disappeared,
a great quantity of hail fell on the earth.</p>

<p>This kind of water-spout appears to be still
different from the other two: it is not mentioned
to have contained water; and it seems,
by what I have related, and by the explanation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
given thereof by M. Andoque, to the academy,
that this water-spout was only a whirlwind,
rendered visible by the dust and condensed vapours
which it contained.</p>

<p>In the same history, anno 1741, a water-spout
is spoken of, seen on the lake of Geneva;
the upper part was inclined to a very black
cloud, and the lower, which was narrower,
terminated a little above the water. This
phenomenon remained only a few minutes, and,
at the moment it was dissipated, a thick vapour
was perceived at the part where it first appeared;
the waters of the lake boiled and
seemed to make an effort to rise up. The air
was very calm during the whole time; and
when it disappeared neither wind nor rain ensued.
"After all we are acquainted with,"
says the historian of the academy, "concerning
water-spouts, is not this another proof
that they are not formed by the conflict of the
winds, but almost always produced by volcanos
or subterraneous vapours, from which we know
the bottom of the sea is not exempt? Whirlwinds
and hurricanes, which we commonly
thought to be the cause of these appearances,
may possibly be only the effect, or an accidental
event thereof."</p>

<p class="caption3">OF VOLCANOS AND EARTHQUAKES.</p>


<p>The burning mountains, called volcanos,
contain in their bowels, sulphur, bitumen,
and other matters of an inflammable nature, the
effects of which are more violent than that of
gunpowder, or even thunder, and have from the
earliest ages terrified mankind, and desolated
the country. A volcano is an immense cannon,
whose orifice is often more than half a league:
from this wide mouth are vomited forth torrents
of smoke and flames, rivers of bitumen, sulphur,
and melted metals, clouds of cinders and stones,
and sometimes it ejects enormous rocks to
many leagues distance, which human powers
united could not move; the conflagration is
so terrible, and the quantity of burnt, melted,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
calcined, and vitrified matters which the mountain
throws out, is so great, that they destroy
cities and forests, cover fields an hundred and
two hundred feet in thickness, and sometimes
form hills and mountains, which are only heaps
of these matters piled up together. The action
of this fire, and the force of its explosion, is
so violent, that it produces by its re-action,
succussions which shake the earth, agitate the
sea, overthrow mountains, and destroy the most
solid towers and edifices, even to very considerable
distances.</p>

<p>These effects, although natural, have been
looked upon as prodigies; and although we see
in miniature, by fire, effects nearly similar to
those of volcanos, yet there is something in
grandeur, of whatever nature it may be, that
invariably strikes the imagination and influences
the mind, and therefore I am not surprised that
some authors have taken them for the vents of
a central fire, and ignorant people for the
mouths of Hell. Astonishment produces
fear, and fear is the mother of superstition.
The natives of Iceland imagine the roarings
of the volcano are the cries of the damned,
and its eruptions the effects of the rage of devils,
and the despair of the wretched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>All its effects, however, arise from fire and
smoke: veins of sulphur, bitumen, and other
inflammable matters, are found in the bowels
of mountains, as well as minerals and pyrites,
which ferment when exposed to air or humidity,
and cause explosions proportionate to the quantity
of inflamed matters. This is the just
idea of a volcano, and it is easy for a philosopher
to imitate the action of these subterranean
fires; for by mixing together a quantity
of brimstone and iron filings, and burying
them in the earth to a certain depth, a small
volcano may be produced, whose effects will
be exactly similar; for this mixture inflames by
fermentation, throws off the earth and stones
with which it is covered, and smokes, flames,
and explodes like a real volcano.</p>

<p>In Europe are three famous volcanos, Mount
Ætna, in Sicily, Mount Hecla, in Iceland, and
Mount Vesuvius, near Naples, in Italy. Mount
Ætna has burnt from time immemorial, its
eruptions are very violent, and the quantity
of matter it throws out is so great that after digging
68 feet deep, marble pavements, and the
vestiges of an ancient town have been found
buried under this thickness of matter, in the
same manner as the city of Herculaneum has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
been covered by the matter thrown out from
Vesuvius. New mouths in Ætna were opened
in 1650, 1669, and at other times. We see
the flame and smoke of this volcano from
Malta, about 60 leagues distance; it smokes
continually, and there are times when it vomits
flames, stones, and matters of every kind with
impetuosity. In 1537, there was an eruption
of this volcano, which caused an earthquake
in Sicily that continued for 12 days, and which
overthrew a number of houses and public
structures; it ceased by the opening of a new
mouth, the lava from which burnt every thing
within five leagues of the mountain. The
cinders thrown out by the volcano were so
abundant, and ejected with so much force, that
they were driven as far as Italy; and vessels at
some distance from Sicily were incommoded
by them. Farelli says the foot of this mountain
is 100 leagues in circumference.</p>

<p>This volcano has now two principal mouths,
one narrower than the other; smoke comes
continually from them, but flames never issue
but during the time of eruptions; it is
pretended that large stones have been
thrown out by them to the distance of 60,000
feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1683 a violent eruption caused a terrible
earthquake in Sicily; it entirely destroyed the
town of Catanea, and killed more than 60,000
persons in that town, besides those which were
destroyed in the neighbouring towns and villages.</p>

<p>Hecla throws out its fires through the ice
and snow of a frozen land; its eruptions are
nevertheless as violent as those of Ætna, and
other volcanos of southern countries. It throws
out cinders, lava, pumice stones, and sometimes
boiling water: it is not inhabitable within six
leagues of this volcano, and the whole island of
Iceland is very abundant in sulphur. The history
of the violent eruptions of Hecla are recorded
by Dithmar Bleffken.</p>

<p>Mount Vesuvius, according to the historians,
did not begin burning till the seventh Consulate
of Titus Vespasian and Falvius Domitian; the
top being opened, it at first threw out stones
and rocks, afterwards fire and lava, which
burnt two neighbouring towns, and emitted
such thick smoke that it obscured the light of
the sun. Pliny the elder, desirous of examining
this conflagration nearer, was suffocated by the
smoke.<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_I_9" id="Footnote_I_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_I_9"><span class="label">[I]</span></a> See the Epistle of Pliny, jun. to Tacitus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p></div>

<p>Dion Cassius relates, that this eruption was
so violent, that cinders and sulphurous smoke
were driven as far as Rome, and even beyond
the Mediterranean into Africa. Heraclea was
one of the two towns burned by this first conflagration
of Vesuvius, which, in these latter
times has been discovered at more than 60 feet
deep, the surface above which was become, by
length of time, arable land and fit for culture.
The relation of the discovery of Heraclea is
in the hands of the public, and we can only
wish that some person, versed in Natural History,
would examine the different matters
which compose this soil of 60 feet, attending
to their disposition and situation, the alterations
they have produced or suffered, the direction
they have taken, and the hardness they have
acquired.</p>

<p>There is an appearance that Naples is
situate on a hollow ground, filled with burning
materials, for Vesuvius and Solfatera seem
to have interior communications. When Vesuvius
casts out lava Solfatera emits flames,
and when the one ceases the other is extinguished.
The city of Naples is situate nearly between
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the last and most violent eruptions
of Mount Vesuvius was in the year 1737.<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a>
The mountain vomited, by several mouths,
large torrents of burning metallic matters,
which dispersed themselves over the country,
and flowed into the sea. Mons. Montealegre,
who communicated this relation to the Academy
of Sciences, observed, with horror, one of these
rivers of fire, whose length, from the mountain
to the sea, was about seven miles, its
breadth about 60 feet, its depth 25 or 30 palms,
and in bottoms or vallies 120: the matter
which flowed was like the scum which issues
from the furnace of a forge, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_J_10" id="Footnote_J_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_J_10"><span class="label">[J]</span></a> It should be remembered, as noticed by Mr. Smellie,
that the original of this work was published by our author
in 1749, since when Vesuvius has undergone several
eruptions.</p></div>

<p>In Asia, particularly in the islands of the
Indian ocean, there are many volcanos; one of
the most famous is Mount Albours, near
Mount Taurus, eight leagues from Herat; its
summit continually smokes, and it frequently
throws out flames and burning matter in such
quantities that the surrounding country is covered
with cinders. In the island of Ternate
there is a volcano which throws out matter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
like pumice-stones. Some travellers assert
that this volcano is most furious at the time of
the equinoxes, because certain winds then reign
there, which inflame the matter that feeds, and
has fed this fire for a number of years.<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_L_12" id="Footnote_L_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_L_12"><span class="label">[L]</span></a> See Argensola's Travels, vol. 1, page 21.</p></div>

<p>The island of Ternate is but seven leagues
round, and is only the summit of a mountain;
it gradually ascends from the shore to the
middle of the island, where the volcano rises
to a considerable height, to the top of which
it is very difficult to attain. Many rills of
sweet water descend along the ridge of this
mountain, and when the air is calm, and the
season mild, this burning gulph is in less agitation
than during storms and high winds.<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a>
This confirms what I have said in a former
article, and seems to prove that the fire of
volcanos does not proceed from any considerable
depth, but from the top, or at least not
far distant from the summit of the mountain;
for if it was not so, the high winds could not
increase their combustion. There are other
volcanos in the Malaccas. In one of the
Mauritius islands, 70 leagues from the Malaccas,
there is a volcano, whose effects are as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
violent as those of Mount Ternate. Sorca
island, one of the Malaccas, was formerly inhabited.
In the middle of this island there is
a lofty mountain, with a volcano at the top.
In 1693 this volcano vomited bitumen and inflamed
matters in such a great quantity as to
form a burning lake, and which covered the
whole island.<a name="FNanchor_N_14" id="FNanchor_N_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a></p>

<p>At Japan, and in the adjacent islands, there
are several volcanos, which emit flames during
the night and smoke in the day. At the Philippine
islands there are also burning mountains.
One of the most famous volcanos of the
islands in the Indian ocean, and the most recent,
is that near the town of Panarucan, in
the island of Java; it opened in 1586, and at
the first eruption, it threw out an enormous
quantity of sulphur, bitumen, and stones. The
same year Mount Gounapi, in the island of
Banda, which continued only seventeen years,
opened and ejected, with a frightful noise,
rocks and matters of every kind. There are
also some other volcanos in India, as at Sumatra,
and in the north of Asia, but those are
not considerable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>In Africa, there is a mountain, or rather a
cavern, called Beniguazeval, near Fez, which
always emits smoke, and sometimes flames.
One of the islands of Cape de Verd, called the
Fuogo, is only a large mountain which burns
continually; this volcano throws out cinders
and stones; and the Portuguese, who have attempted
several times to erect habitations in
this island, have been constrained to abandon
the project through dread of the volcano. The
Peak of Teneriffe, considered as one of the highest
mountains of the earth, throws out fire, cinders,
and large stones; from its top rivulets of
melted sulphur flow across the snow, where it
forms veins that are distinguishable at a great
distance.</p>

<p>In America there are a great number of volcanos,
particularly in the mountains of Peru and
Mexico; that of Arequipa is one of the most
famous; it often causes earthquakes, which are
more common in Peru than in any other country
in the world. The volcano of Carrappa and
that of Malahallo are, according to the report
of travellers, the most considerable, next to
that of Arequipa; but there are many others
in these parts of which we have no exact knowledge.
M. Bouguer, in his voyage to Peru,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
published in the Memoirs of the Academy of the
year 1744, mentions two volcanos, called Cotopaxi
and Pichincha; the first at some distance
from, the other near the town of Quito; he was
witness of a conflagration of Botopaxi in 1742,
and of the orifice which was made in that mountain;
this eruption did no other damage than
melting the snow and producing such torrents of
water, that in less than three hours inundated a
tract of country 18 leagues in extent, and overthrew
all they met with in their way.</p>

<p>At Mexico the most considerable volcanos
are Popochampeche, and the Popoatepec; it was
near this last that Cortes passed in his voyage to
Mexico; some of the Spaniards ascended to the
top, where they saw the mouth, which was
about half a league in circumference. Sulphurous
mountains are also met with at Guadaloupe,
Tercera, and other islands of the Azores;
and, if we were to consider as volcanos all
those mountains which smoke, or emit flames,
we might reckon more than sixty; we have only
spoken of those formidable volcanos, near which
no person dares to inhabit.</p>

<p>These volcanos which are in such great numbers
in the Cordeliers, as I have formerly said,
cause almost continual earthquakes, which prevent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the natives from building with stone
above one story high, and to construct the
upper stories of their houses with reeds and
light wood. In these mountains are also many
precipices and large vents, the sides of which
are black and burnt, as in the precipice of
Mount Ararat, in Armenia, which is called the
Abyss; these abysses are the mouths of extinguished
volcanos.</p>

<p>There was lately an earthquake at Lima,
the effects of which were dreadful. The town
of Lima and Port Callao were almost entirely
swallowed up; but the evil was still greater at
Callao. The sea rose and covered every building
in that town, drowned all the inhabitants,
and left only one single tower remaining. Of
twenty-five ships that were in this port, four
were carried a league upon land, and the rest
were swallowed up by the sea. At Lima, which
was a large town, there remains only twenty-seven
houses standing; a great number of persons
were buried in the ruins, particularly
monks and religious persons, as their buildings
were higher and constructed of more solid materials
than the other houses. This misfortune
happened at night, in October 1746; the shock
remained fifteen minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>There was formerly near the port of Pisca,
in Peru, a famous city, situate on the sea shore,
which was almost entirely destroyed by an earthquake
that happened the 19th of October 1682,
for the sea having extended beyond its common
bounds, swallowed up this unfortunate place
with every person that was in it.</p>

<p>If we consult historians and travellers, we
shall find relations of many earthquakes and
eruptions of volcanos, whose effects have been
as terrible as those we have just mentioned.
Pesidonius, whom Strabo quotes in his first
book, relates, that a city in Ph&#339;nicia, near
Sidon, was swallowed up by an earthquake,
with the neighbouring territory, and even two
thirds of Sidon; this effect was not so sudden
but that many of the inhabitants had time
to avoid it by flight. This shock extended
throughout all Syria, and as far as the Cyclade
islands, and into Eub&#339;a, where the fountains
of Arethusa suddenly stopped, and did not reappear
for many days after, and then by many
new springs remote from the old ones; that
this earthquake did not cease from shaking the
island, sometimes in one part and sometimes in
another, until the earth opened in the valley
of Lepanta, and ejected a great quantity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
lava and other inflamed matters. Pliny, in
his first book, chap. 84, relates, that in the
reign of Tiberius an earthquake happened
which overthrew twelve towns in Asia: and in
his second book he mentions a prodigy caused
by an earthquake. St. Augustin records, that
by a great earthquake there were towns overthrown
in Lybia. In the time of Trajan, the
town of Antioch, and a great part of the adjacent
country were swallowed up by an earthquake;
and in the time of Justinian, in 528,
it was a second time destroyed by the same
cause, with upwards of 40,000 of its inhabitants.
Sixty years after, in the time of St.
Gregory, it felt the effects of a third earthquake,
when 60,000 of its inhabitants perished.
In the time of Saladin, in 1182, most of the
towns of Syria and Judea were destroyed by
the same calamity. In Calabria and Apulia,
there have been more earthquakes than in any
other part of Europe. In the time of Pope
Pius II. all the churches and palaces of Naples
were overthrown, and above 30,000 of its inhabitants
killed; the remainder were obliged to
live in tents till houses were built. In 1629,
there were earthquakes in Apulia, which destroyed
7000 persons, and in 1638, the town
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
of St. Euphemia was swallowed up, and there
remains only a stinking lake in its place.
Ragusa and Smyrna, at the same time, were
also almost destroyed. There was an earthquake
in 1692, which extended into England,
Holland, Flanders, Germany, and France;
it was chiefly felt on the sea coasts and near
large rivers; it shook at least 2600 square
leagues; it lasted only two minutes, and the
motion was more considerable on mountains
than in vallies.<a name="FNanchor_O_15" id="FNanchor_O_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a> On the 10th of July, 1688,
there was an earthquake at Smyrna, which
began by a motion from west to east; the castle
was at first overthrown, its four walls being
divided and sunk six feet in the sea; this castle
stood upon an isthmus, but is at present a
real island, about 100 paces distant from the
land. The walls from east to west are fallen
down, those from north to south are yet standing;
the city, which is ten miles from the castle,
was destroyed shortly after; in many places the
earth opened, and subterraneous noises were
heard; five or six shocks were felt as night
came on, the last continued only half a minute;
the ships in the roads were shaken; the ground
of the town was lowered about two feet; not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
above a quarter of the town withstood the
shock, and those principally the houses which
stood on rocks; from 15 to 20,000 persons
are computed to have been buried under the
ruins.<a name="FNanchor_P_16" id="FNanchor_P_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a> In 1695, an earthquake was felt at
Bologna, in Italy, and it was remarked as a particular
circumstance, that the water was much
troubled a day before.<a name="FNanchor_Q_17" id="FNanchor_Q_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_Q_17" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a><a name="FNanchor_R_18" id="FNanchor_R_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_R_18" class="fnanchor">[R]</a></p>

<p>At Tercera there happened an earthquake
on the 4th of May, 1614, which overthrew in
the town of Angra eleven churches and nine
chapels, besides private houses; and in the
town of Praya it was so terrible, that scarcely
an house was left standing. On the 16th of
June 1628, there was an earthquake in the
island of St. Michael, the effects of which was
so great, that in a place where the sea was more
than 150 fathoms deep an island was thrown
up more than a league and a half long, and upwards
of 60 fathoms high. Another happened
in 1691, in the island of St. Michael, which
began the 6th of July, and lasted till the 12th
of the following month: Tercera and Fayal
were agitated the next morning with so much
violence, that they appeared to move; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
these frightful shocks returned there only four
times, whereas at St. Michael they did not
cease a moment for several days. The islanders
quitted their houses, which they saw fall before
their eyes, and remained all the time in the
fields exposed to the injuries of the weather.
The whole town of Villa Franca was overthrown
to its very foundation, and most of the
inhabitants buried under its ruins. In many
parts the plains rose into hills, and in others,
mountains were flattened into vallies. A spring
of water issued from the earth, which flowed
for four days, and then ceased all on a sudden.
The air and sea, still more agitated, resounded
with a noise which might have been taken for
the roaring of a number of wild animals.
Many persons died with the fright; the ships
in the harbour suffered dangerous shocks, and
those which were at anchor, or under sail at 20
leagues distant from the islands, received great
damage. Earthquakes are frequent in the
Azores, and about twenty years before a mountain
in St. Michael was overturned by one of
them.<a name="FNanchor_S_19" id="FNanchor_S_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_S_19" class="fnanchor">[S]</a></p>

<p>In Manilla, in the month of September,
1627, an earthquake levelled one of the two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
mountains called Carvallos, in the province of
Cagayon; in 1645, one third of the town was
destroyed by a like accident, and 300 persons
perished. The succeeding year it experienced
another; and the ancient Indians say they were
more terrible formerly, which was the reason
they build their houses only of wood; a custom
still continued, and which the Spaniards
follow.<a name="FNanchor_T_20" id="FNanchor_T_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_T_20" class="fnanchor">[T]</a></p>

<p>"The quantity of volcanos in this island confirms
that assertion; because at certain times
they vomit forth flames, shake the earth, and
perform all the effects Pliny attributes to those
of Vesuvius; that is, they change the beds of
rivers, drive back the adjacent sea, fill with cinders
the neighbouring plains, and throw out
stones to great distances, with reports louder
than those of cannons.</p>

<p>"In 1646, a mountain in the island of Machian
split by an earthquake, with a dreadful
noise; from this opening issued a number of
flames, which destroyed several plantations with
the inhabitants and all that was therein. In the
year 1685, this prodigious crack was to be
seen, and probably is still apparent; it is called
the path of Machian, because it descends from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the top to the bottom, like a road hollowed out,
but which at a distance appears like a path."<a name="FNanchor_U_21" id="FNanchor_U_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_U_21" class="fnanchor">[U]</a></p>

<p>The history of the French Academy mentions
in the following terms, the earthquakes
that took place in 1702 and 1703. "The
earthquakes began in Italy in October 1702,
and continued, till July 1703; the country
which suffered the most by them, and where
they began, is the town of Norcia, with its dependencies
under the ecclesiastical government,
and the province of Abruzzo, which are situated
at the foot of the Apennines on the south
side.</p>

<p>"They were often accompanied with terrible
noises in the air, which also were heard
without any dreadful effects, when the sky was
serene. The earthquake which happened on
the 2d of February 1703, was the most violent;
it was accompanied, at least at Rome, with a
great serenity of sky and calmness in the air.
It lasted at Rome half a minute, and at Aquila
the capital of Abruzzo three hours. It destroyed
the whole town of Aquila, buried 5000 persons
under the ruins, and made great havock in the
environs. The vibration of the earth, according
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
to the observations made by the lamps in
the churches, was from south to north.</p>

<p>"It opened two places from whence issued a
great quantity of stones, which entirely covered
it and rendered it barren; after the stones they
threw out water above the height of the trees;
this lasted half an hour, and inundated the
adjacent fields. The water was whitish, like
soap suds, and had not any remarkable taste.</p>

<p>"A mountain near Sigillo, a city twenty-two
miles distant from Aquila, had on its summit
a very large plain surrounded with rocks
like a wall. The earthquake of the 2d of
February, changed this plain into a gulph
of unequal breadth, whose greatest diameter is
twenty-five fathoms and the least twenty; the
depth of it has not been discovered, although
a line 300 fathoms has been let down in it. At
the time this opening was made, flames were
seen to issue out, and afterwards a great smoke
which lasted three days with some interruptions.</p>

<p>"At Genoa on the 1st and 2d of July 1703,
there were two slight earthquakes, the last was
felt only by the people on the pier: at the same
time the sea in the port sunk six feet, and remained
so a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>"The sulphurous water in the road from
Rome to Tivoli it diminished two feet and a
half, both in the bason and in the canal. In
many places of the plain, called Testine, the
springs and rivulets, which formed morasses,
are all dried up. The waters of the lake
called l'Enfer is also lowered three feet. In
place of the ancient springs new ones have
appeared at above a league distance, so that
possibly they are the same waters which have
changed direction<a name="FNanchor_V_22" id="FNanchor_V_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_V_22" class="fnanchor">[V]</a>.</p>

<p>"The same earthquake which, in 1538,
formed Monti di Cinere, near Pozzoli, filled
lake Lucrin with stones, earth and cinders, so
that this lake is now a marshy ground.<a name="FNanchor_W_23" id="FNanchor_W_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_W_23" class="fnanchor">[W]</a></p>

<p>"There are earthquakes also felt at some
distance at sea, says Mr. Shaw; in 1774, being
on board the Gazella, an Algerine vessel,
mounting 50 guns, three violent shocks were
felt one after the other, as if every time a
weight of 20 or 30 tons had been thrown on
the ballast. This happened on a part of the
Mediterranean that was more than 200 fathom
deep. He relates also, that others had
felt earthquakes much more considerable in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
other parts, and one among the rest at 40 leagues
west from Lisbon."<a name="FNanchor_X_24" id="FNanchor_X_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_X_24" class="fnanchor">[X]</a></p>

<p>Schouten, speaking of an earthquake in the
Malacca islands, says, that the mountains were
shaken, and the vessels at anchor in 30 or 40
fathoms water were shook, as if they had struck
against rocks or banks. "Experience, continues
he, teaches us every day that the same
happens in the open sea, where no bottom is
to be met with, and that ships are tossed to
and fro by earthquakes, even where the sea is
tranquil."</p>

<p>Gentil, in his voyage round the world,
speaks of earthquakes in the following terms:
"I have, says he, made some remarks on these
earthquakes; first, that half an hour before the
earth is agitated every animal is struck with
fear; horses snort, break their fastenings, and
fly from the stable; dogs bark; birds, as if
stupified, fly into houses for safety; and rats
and mice quit their holes. Secondly, that
vessels at anchor are so violently agitated, that
every part of them seems as if going to pieces,
the cannons force themselves loose, and the
masts break in several places. These facts I
should scarcely have given credit to if many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
unanimous testimonies had not convinced me.
I know the bottom of the sea is a continuation
of the land, and that if one is agitated it will
communicate to the other; but I could not
conceive how every part of a vessel, floating in
a fluid, should be affected in the same manner
as if she was on the earth: it appeared to me
that her motion should have been such as she
experiences in a storm; besides, in the circumstance
which I speak of, the surface of the sea
was smooth, and there was no wind. Thirdly,
that if the cavern of the earth, where this subterraneous
fire is contained, has a direction
from north to south, and if the buildings of an
adjacent town are in a parallel line with it, all
the houses are overthrown, whereas if this vein
or cavern executes its effects by the breadth of
the town, the devastation of the earthquake, is
much less considerable."<a name="FNanchor_Y_25" id="FNanchor_Y_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_Y_25" class="fnanchor">[Y]</a></p>

<p>In countries subject to earthquakes, when
a new volcano breaks out earthquakes cease,
and are only felt in the violent eruptions of
the volcano, as is observed in the island of St.
Christopher.<a name="FNanchor_Z_26" id="FNanchor_Z_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_Z_26" class="fnanchor">[Z]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p></div>

<p>The enormous ravages produced by earthquakes
have made some naturalists think that
mountains and other inequalities of the surface
of the globe were only the effects of subterraneous
fires, and that all the irregularities must
be attributed to the violent shocks which they
have produced. This, for example, is the
opinion of Mr. Ray; he imagines that all
mountains have been formed by earthquakes,
or the explosion of volcanos, as Monti di
Cinere, the new island near Santorini, &amp;c.
but he has not considered that the slight elevations
formed by the eruption of a volcano, or by
the action of an earthquake, are not internally
composed of horizontal strata, as all other
mountains are; for by digging in the Monti
di Cinere we meet with calcined stones, cinders,
burnt earths, metallic dross, pumice-stones,
&amp;c. all mixed and confounded like a
heap. Besides, if earthquakes and subterraneous
fires had produced the great mountains of
the earth, as the Cordeliers, Mount Taurus,
the Alps, &amp;c. the prodigious force necessary to
raise these enormous masses might, at the same
time, have destroyed a great part of the surface
of the globe; and earthquakes, requisite to
produce such effects, must have been of inconceivable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
violence, since the most famous of which
history makes mention have not had sufficient
power to form a single mountain; for example,
in the time of Valentian I. an earthquake happened,
which was felt throughout all the known
world;<a name="FNanchor_AA_27" id="FNanchor_AA_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_AA_27" class="fnanchor">[AA]</a> and yet not a mountain was thrown
up by it.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_AA_27" id="Footnote_AA_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AA_27"><span class="label">[AA]</span></a> As Ammianus Marcellinus relates, lib. 26. cap. 14.</p></div>

<p>It is nevertheless certain, that although we
might be able to find an earthquake sufficiently
powerful to throw up the highest mountains,
it would not be sufficient to disorder the rest of
the globe.</p>

<p>For supposing that the chain of the highest
mountains which cross South America from
the Magellanic lands to New Grenada, and the
Gulph of Darien, had been produced by an
earthquake, and then let us see by calculations
the effect of this explosion. This chain of
mountains is near 1700 leagues in length, and
commonly 40 in breadth, comprehending the
Sieras, which are not so lofty as the Andes.
The surface therefore is 68,000 square leagues;
I suppose the thickness of the matter displaced
by the earthquake to be about one
league, that is, the height of these mountains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
taken from the top to the caverns, which according
to this hypothesis must support them,
is one league, then I say, the power of an explosion
must have raised a quantity of earth
equal to 68,000 cubical leagues to a league in
height. Now the action being equal to the re-action,
this explosion must have communicated
the same motion to the rest of the globe. The
whole globe consists of 12,310,523,801 cubical
leagues, from which subtracting 68,000, there
remains 12,310,455,801 cubical leagues, the
quantity of which motion will be equal to that
of 68,000 cubical leagues raised one league;
from whence we perceive that the force which
will have been great enough to elevate 68,000
cubical leagues would not have displaced the
whole globe a single inch.</p>

<p>There would therefore be no absolute impossibility
in the supposition that mountains
have been raised by earthquakes, if their internal
composition as well as their external
form were not evident proofs of their
being the work of the sea. Their internal
parts are composed of regular and parallel
strata, intermingled with shells, and their external
consists of a figure whose angles are
every where correspondent: is it credible then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
that this uniform composition and regular form
should have been produced by irregular shocks
and sudden explosions?</p>

<p>But as this opinion has prevailed among
some philosophers, and as the nature and effects
of earthquakes are not well understood,
it may possibly be pertinent to hazard a few
ideas with a view of explaining those intricate
subjects.</p>

<p>The earth has undergone great changes on
its surface; we find at considerable depths,
holes, caverns, subterraneous rivulets, and
void places, which sometimes communicate by
chinks, &amp;c. There are two kinds of caverns;
the first are those produced by the action of
subterraneous fires and volcanos; the action of
this fire uplifts, burns, and throws out to a
distance the matters that are above, and at the
same time divides and deranges those which are
on the sides, and thus produces caverns, grottos,
and irregular holes, but which however is
only effected in the environs of volcanos; and
these kinds of caverns are more rare than those
produced by water. We have already observed
that the different strata which compose the
terrestrial globe are all interrupted by perpendicular
fissures: the waters which fall on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the surface descend through them; collect when
stopped by clay, and form springs and rivulets;
by their natural propensities they seek out cavities
or small vacancies, and always incline
to open a passage till they find a vent, carrying
along with them sand, gravel, and other matters
they can divide and dissolve; by degrees, in
the internal part of the earth they form small
trenches; and at last issue forth in the form of
springs, either at the surface of the earth, or
bottom of the sea; the matters which they carry
along with them, leave caverns whose extent
may be very considerable, the origin of which
is quite different from those produced by volcanos
or earthquakes.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of earthquakes, the one
caused by the action of subterraneous fires, and
the explosion of volcanos which are only felt at
small distances at the time of eruptions: when
the matters which form subterraneous fires
ferment, heat, and inflame, the fire makes an
effort on every side to get out, and if it does
not find a natural vent, it raises the earth above
and forces itself a passage by throwing it out;
such is the beginning of a volcano whose effects
and continuation are in proportion to the quantity
of inflammable matters they contain. If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
the quantity of matters is not considerable, an
earthquake may ensue, without a volcano being
formed. The air rarefied by the subterraneous
fire may also escape through small vents, and in
this case there will be only a shock without any
eruption or volcano. But when the inflamed
matter is in great quantities and confined by
solid and compressed bodies, then a commotion
and volcano is certain to ensue; but all these
commotions form only the first kind of earthquakes,
and can only shake a small space of
ground. A violent eruption of Ætna will
cause, for example, an earthquake throughout
the whole island of Sicily; but it will never
extend to the distance of three or four hundred
leagues. When any new mouth bursts out
in Vesuvius, there are earthquakes at Naples,
and in the neighbourhood of the volcano; but
these earthquakes never shake the Alps, nor
extend into France, or other countries remote
from Vesuvius. Therefore earthquakes produced
by volcanos, are limited to a small space,
are properly but the effects of the re-action
of the fire; and they shake the earth, as
the explosion of a powder magazine produces
a shock perceptible at many leagues
distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>But there is another kind of earthquake very
different in its effects, and perhaps equally so
in its cause; such are felt at great distances, and
shake a long course of ground, without any
new volcano, or eruption in the old ones appearing.
We have instances of earthquakes being
felt at the same time in England, France, Germany,
and even in Hungary; these earthquakes
always extend more in length than breadth;
they shake a zone of ground with greater or less
violence in different places, and are almost always
accompanied with a rumbling noise like
that of a coach rolling over the stones with rapidity.</p>

<p>With respect to the causes of this kind of
earthquake, it must be remembered that the explosion
of all inflammable matters produces,
like gunpowder, a great quantity of air; that
this air by the heat is in a state of very great rarefaction,
and that by its state of compression
in the bowels of the earth, it must produce very
violent effects. Let us suppose, that at a depth
of one or two hundred fathoms, pyrites and
other sulphurous matters are collected in great
quantities, and that by the fermentation produced
by the filtration of the water, or other
causes, they inflame; what must happen? First
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
these matters are not placed in horizontal layers,
as are the ancient strata, which have been
formed by the sediment of the waters; on the
contrary, they are formed in perpendicular fissures,
in caverns, and in other places where the
water can penetrate. Inflaming, they produce
a quantity of air, the spring of which being
compressed in a small space, like that of a cavern,
will not only shake the ground directly
above, but will seek out for passages by which
it may escape. The roads which offer themselves
are caverns and trenches, formed by subterraneous
rivulets: into these the rarefied air
will precipitate with violence, form in them a
strong wind, the noise of which will be heard
at the surface, accompanied with shocks of the
earth, &amp;c. this subterraneous wind, produced by
the fire, will extend as far as the subterraneous
cavities, and cause an agitation more or less
violent as it is distant from the vent, and finds
the passages of a larger or lesser extent: this
motion being made longitudinal, the shock will
be the same, and the earthquake be felt through
a long zone of ground. This air will not produce
any eruption, or volcano, because it will
find sufficient space to expand, or rather because
it will have found vents, and issue forth in form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
of wind and vapour. Even should it not be
allowed that there exist internal passages, by
which the air and vapours can pass, it may be
conceived that in the place where the first explosion
is made, the ground being lifted up to a
considerable height, that the most adjoining
to this spot must divide and split in an horizontal
manner by the force of its motion; and by
this means passages communicating one with
the other may be opened to great distances; and
this explanation agrees with every phenomena.
It is not at the same moment or hour that an
earthquake is felt in two distant places. Neither
fire nor eruption attend those earthquakes
which are heard at a distance, and the noise
always marks the progressive motion of this
subterraneous wind. This theory is confirmed
by two other facts; it is well known that mines
exhale unhealthy air and suffocating vapours,
independent of the wind produced by the current
of water: it is also known that there are
holes, abysses and deep lakes in the earth, which
produce winds, as the lake Boleslaw, in Bohemia,
which we have already spoken of.</p>

<p>All this being considered, I do not see how it
can be imagined that earthquakes produce mountains,
since the cause itself of these earthquakes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
are mineral and sulphurous matters, which are
generally found only in perpendicular clefts of
mountains and other cavities of the earth; the
greatest number of which have been produced
by the operation of water; since this matter by
inflaming produces only a momentary explosion
and a violent wind which follows the subterraneous
roads of the water: since the duration of
the earthquakes at the surface of the earth is so
short that their cause can only be explosion and
not a durable fire: and in short, since these earthquakes,
which extend to a considerable distance,
very far from raising chains of mountains, do
not produce the smallest hills throughout their
whole extent.</p>

<p>Earthquakes are, in fact, most frequent in
places near volcanos, as in Sicily and Naples,
but it is known, by observations, that the most
violent earthquakes happen in the time of the
greatest eruptions of volcanos; that they are
very limited, and cannot produce a chain of
mountains.</p>

<p>It has been sometimes observed, that the
matters thrown out of Mount Ætna, after laying
for many years and afterwards moistened
with the rain, have rekindled and thrown out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
flames with such violent explosions as even to
produce a slight shock.</p>

<p>In a furious eruption of Ætna in 1669, which
began the 11th of March, the summit of the
mountains sunk considerably;<a name="FNanchor_AB_28" id="FNanchor_AB_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_AB_28" class="fnanchor">[AB]</a> which proves
the fire of this volcano comes rather from the
top than from the bottom of the mountain.
Borelli is of the same opinion, and says, "That
the fire of volcanos does not proceed from the
centre, nor from the foot of the mountain, but
that it issues from the summit, and flames kindle
but at a small depth."<a name="FNanchor_AC_29" id="FNanchor_AC_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_AC_29" class="fnanchor">[AC]</a></p>

<p>Mount Vesuvius in its eruptions, has thrown
out great quantities of boiling water. Mr. Ray,
who thinks that the volcanean fire proceeds
from a great depth, says, that it is the water of
the sea which communicates by subterraneous
passages with the foot of the mountain; he gives,
as a proof of it, the dryness of the summit of
Vesuvius, and the agitation of the sea at the
time of these eruptions, which sometimes retreats
from the coasts, and leaves the Bay of Naples
almost dry. But, if these facts are true, they do
not prove, in a solid manner, that the volcanean
fire proceeds from a great depth; for the water
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
which is thrown out is certainly rain water,
which penetrates through the fissure, and collects
in the cavities of the mountains. Rills and
rivulets flow from those containing volcanos as
well as other lofty mountains, and as they are
hollow, and have been more shaken, it is not
astonishing that the water collects in their caverns
in their internal part, and that these
waters are thrown out in the time of eruptions
with other matters. With respect to the motion
of the sea, it proceeds solely from the shock
communicated to the waters by the explosion,
which causes them to advance or retreat according
to different circumstances.</p>

<p>The matters which volcanos generally throw
out, come forth in the form of a torrent of
melted minerals, which inundates all the environs
of those mountains; these rivers of liquified
matters extend to considerable distances,
and in cooling form horizontal or inclined
strata, which for position are like the strata
formed by the sediment left by the waters: but
it is very easy to distinguish the one from the
other. First, because strata of lava are not
throughout of an equal thickness: secondly,
because they contain only matters which have
evidently been calcined, vitrified, or melted;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
and thirdly, because they do not extend to any
great distance. As there are a great number
of volcanos at Peru, and as the foot of most of
the mountains of the Cordeliers is covered
with matters thrown out by eruptions, it is not
astonishing that marine shells are not met with
there, as they must have been calcined and
destroyed by the fire; but I am persuaded, if
we dig in argilaceous earth, which, according
to M. Bourguet, is the common earth of the
valley of Quito, shells would be found there,
as they are in other places, at least where the
ground is not covered, like that at the foot of
the mountains, with matters thrown out of a
volcano.</p>

<p>It has often been asked, why volcanos are
all met with at the top of mountains? I think
I have partly given a satisfactory answer to this
question in the preceding article, but I have
thought it necessary not to finish this without
farther explaining what I have said on this subject.</p>

<p>The peaks or points of mountains were formerly
covered with sand and earth, which the
rain gradually washes along with it into the
vallies, and has left only the rocks and stone,
which forms the nucleus of the mountain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
This being left bare will have been still worn
by the injuries of the air, the frost will have
loosened the large and small parts, which of
course have rolled to the bottom. The rocks,
at the base of the summit, being left bare, and
no longer supported by the earth which surrounded
them, will have given way a little, and
by dividing one from the other formed small
intervals. This separation of the lower rocks
could not be made without communicating a
greater motion to the upper. By this means
the nucleus of the mountain would be divided
into an infinity of perpendicular clefts, from
the summit to the base of the lower rocks;
the rain will have penetrated into all these
clefts, and loosened, in the inside of the mountain,
all the mineral parts and other matters
that it could carry away or dissolve; they will
have formed pyrites and other combustible
matters, and when by length of time these
matters were accumulated in great quantities,
they fermented, and by inflaming produced
explosions and other effects of volcanos; perhaps
likewise, within the mountains, there
were masses of these mineral matters already
formed before the rain could penetrate therein;
in that case, as soon as holes and clefts were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
made, which gave passages to the water and
air, these matters inflamed and formed a volcano.
None of these motions could be made in plains,
since all is at rest and nothing can be displaced.
It is not therefore surprising that volcanos are
found only in high mountains.</p>

<p>When coal-mines are opened, which are
generally met with in argile earth, at a great
depth, it sometimes happens that the mineral
substances have taken fire: there are even
mines of coal in Scotland, Flanders, &amp;c. which
have burnt for a number of years. The admission
of the air suffices to produce this effect;
but these fires produce only slight explosions,
and do not form volcanos, because all being
solid and full in these places, fire cannot be excited
like that of volcanos, in which there are
cavities and void places where the air penetrates,
which must necessarily extend the conflagration
and augment the action of the fire,
so as to produce the terrible effects we have just
described.</p>

<p class="caption3">OF NEW ISLANDS, CAVERNS, PERPENDICULAR
CLEFTS, &amp;C. &amp;C.</p>


<p>New islands are formed either suddenly
by the action of subterraneous fires, or
gently by the deposit of the sediment of waters.
Ancient historians and modern travellers relate
facts on this subject which put it beyond all
kind of doubt. Seneca assures us, that in his
time the island Therasia appeared suddenly in
the sea, to the astonishment of many mariners
who beheld it. Pliny relates, that formerly
thirteen islands in the Mediterranean sprung at
the same instant out of the sea, and that Rhodes
and Delos are the principal of them: it appears,
from him, as well as Ammianus Marcellinus,
Philo, and others, that these thirteen
islands were not produced by an earthquake,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
nor by any subterraneous explosion, but that
they were formerly hid under the water, which
lowering left them uncovered. Delos had the
name of Pelagia given to it, from having formerly
belonged to the sea. Whether the origin
of these thirteen islands is to be attributed to
the action of subterraneous fires, or to some
other cause which might occasion a sinking of
the water in the Mediterranean, is uncertain.
But Pliny relates, that the island Hiera, near
Therasia, had been formed of ferruginous
masses, and earth thrown from the bottom of
the sea; and in chapter 89, he speaks of other
islands formed in the like manner; but on this
subject we have more clear and certain facts of
later date.</p>

<p>On the 23d of May 1707, at the sun's
rising, there was seen, at some little distance
from the island of Therasia, or Santorini,
something like a floating rock in the sea; some
persons, to satisfy their curiosity, went towards
it, and found it a shoal which had issued from
the bottom of the sea; it increased under their
feet, and they brought with them the pumice-stone
and oysters, which the rock still had attached
to its surface. There was a slight
earthquake at Santorini two days before this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
shoal appeared: it increased considerably till
the 14th of June, it was then half a mile
round, and from 20 to 30 feet high; the earth
was white, and a little argilaceous; after that
the sea became more and more troubled; vapours
arose which infected the island Santorini;
and on the 16th of July several rocks were
seen to issue at one time from the bottom of
the sea, and unite into one solid body. This
was accompanied with a dismal noise, which
continued upwards of two months. Flames
issued from the new island, which kept increasing
in circumference and height, and the violent
explosions frequently threw large stones
to more than seven miles distance. The island
Santorini itself was deemed among the ancients
as a modern production, and in 726, 1427,
and 1573, it increased in size, and small islands
were formed near it.<a name="FNanchor_AD_30" id="FNanchor_AD_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_AD_30" class="fnanchor">[AD]</a> The same volcano,
which in the time of Seneca formed the island
of Santorini, in that of Pliny produced Hiera or
Volcanella, and in our time the shoal above-mentioned.</p>

<p>On the 10th of October 1720, near the
island Tercera, a very considerable fire arose
out of the sea; some mariners were sent by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the order of the governor to take a view of it,
and who having come near it, perceived, on
the 19th of the same month, an island which
appeared only as fire and smoke, with a prodigious
quantity of ashes thrown to a distance,
as if caused by the force of a volcano, with a
report like that of thunder. An earthquake
happened at the same time, which was felt in
the circumjacent places, and great quantities of
pumice-stones were observed floating on the
sea around the new island; pumice-stones indeed
have sometimes been seen swimming in
the midst of the high seas.<a name="FNanchor_AE_31" id="FNanchor_AE_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_AE_31" class="fnanchor">[AE]</a></p>

<p>The historian of the academy, anno 1721,
says on this event, that after an earthquake in
the island of St. Michael, one of the Azores,
there appeared between this island and Tercera
a torrent of fire, which gave birth to two new
shoals; and the next year he gave the following
detail:</p>

<p>"M. de l'Isle has informed the academy
of many particulars concerning the new island
among the Azores, which he received in a
letter from M. de Montagnac, consul at
Lisbon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>"Being in a vessel, which was moored the
18th of September 1721, before the fortress
of the town of St. Michael, M. de Montagnac
learnt the following account from the pilot:</p>

<p>"On the 7th of December 1720, at night,
there was a great earthquake in Tercera and
St. Michael, which are about 18 leagues apart,
and between which a new island sprung up:
it was remarked at the same time, that the
point of the island of Peak, 30 leagues distant,
and which before threw out fire, was sunk and
emitted none; but the new island kept throwing
out a constant thick smoke, and which I
plainly perceived from the vessel I was in.
The pilot assured us that he had gone round
the island, rowing as near it as he conceived to
be safe. On the south side he threw a line of
sixty fathoms without finding any bottom; on
the west side the water was greatly changed,
appearing white, blue and green, and which
extended two thirds of a league, where it
seemed ready to boil. On the north-west, the
part from which the smoke issued, he found,
at 15 fathoms, a bottom of thick sand; he
threw a stone in the sea, and where it fell the
water seemed to boil and bubble with impetuosity;
the bottom was so hot that it twice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
melted some grease fastened at the end of the
sounding line. The pilot observed also on
that side that smoke issued from a small lake
bounded by a sand bank. This island is almost
round and high enough to be perceived
at the distance of seven or eight leagues in
clear weather.</p>

<p>"It has since been learnt from a letter of
M. Adrian, French consul in the island of St.
Michael, dated March 1722, that the new
island had considerably diminished, that it was
almost level with the water, and there was
every appearance it would not last long."</p>

<p>It is therefore by these, and a great number
of other facts of a similar nature, very evident
that inflammable matters are enclosed in the
earth under the bottom of the sea, and that they
sometimes cause violent explosions. The places
where this happens might be termed marine
volcanos, and which differ from common volcanos
only by the shortness of the duration of
their effects; for the fire having opened itself
a passage, the water must penetrate therein and
extinguish it. The elevation of new islands
must consequently leave a void space which the
water would shortly occupy, and this new earth,
which is only composed of matters thrown out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
by the marine volcano, must resemble that of
Monti di Cinere and other eminencies which
terrestrial volcanos have formed. Now as the
water rushes in, during the violence of the
explosion, and fills the vacancies that it occasions,
that is clearly the reason why these
marine volcanos act less frequently than other
volcanos, although the causes of both are the
same.</p>

<p>These subterraneous, or sub-marine fires
are doubtless the cause of all those ebullitions
of the sea, which sailors have remarked in
various places, and as well as of the water-spouts
we have before mentioned; they likewise
produce storms and earthquakes, which
are not less felt on the sea than on the land.
Islands formed by these sub-marine volcanos,
are generally composed of pumice-stone,
and calcined rocks, and produce, like those
of the land, violent earthquakes and commotions.</p>

<p>Fires have been often observed on the surface
of the water. Pliny tells us that the lake
Thrasimenia appeared inflamed over all its surface.
Agricola relates that when a stone was
thrown into the lake Denstat, in Thuringia,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
it appeared, as it descended in the water, like a
train of fire.</p>

<p>In short, the quantities of pumice-stones
which travellers affirm are met with in many
parts of the ocean, and the Mediterranean,
prove there are volcanos at the bottom of the
sea, similar to those we are acquainted with,
and which differ not in the least from them,
neither by the matters they cast out, nor by the
violence of the explosion, but solely by the
rarity and shortness of the duration of their
effects. From hence we may fairly infer that
the bottom of the sea in every respect resembles
the surface of the earth.</p>

<p>We shall find many connections between
land and sea volcanos; both are found at the
summit of mountains. The islands of Azores
and those of the Archipelago are only peaks
of mountains, some of which rise above the
water, and others are underneath. By the
account of the new islands among the Azores
we see that the part from whence the smoke
issued was only 15 fathoms under water, which,
compared with the common depth of the ocean,
proves that even this part is the summit of a
mountain; as much may be said of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
new island near Santorini, which could not be
any great depth, since oysters were found attached
to the rocks which rose above the
water. It appears also that marine-volcanos
have, like those of the land, subterraneous
communications, since the summit of the volcano
of St. George, in the island Peak, sunk at
the time the new island among the Azores arose.
It must also be observed, that these new islands
never appear but near the old ones, and that
we have no example of new islands in the high
seas; we must therefore look on them as a
continuation of the adjacent islands; and when
ancient islands have volcanos, it is not astonishing
that the ground adjacent should contain
matters proper to form them, and which inflame,
either by fermentation alone, or by the
action of subterraneous winds.</p>

<p>Islands produced by the action of fire and
earthquakes are but few, but there are an infinite
number produced by the mud, sand, and
earth, which the rivers or the sea transport
into different places. At the mouth of rivers
earth and sand accumulate in such quantities
as to form islands of a moderate extent. The
sea, retiring from certain coasts, leaves the
highest parts of the bottom naked, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
forms so many new islands; so likewise the sea,
by extending itself on certain shores, covers
the lowest parts, and leaves the highest, which
appear as so many islands; and thus it is we
may account for there being so few islands in
the open sea, and so many bordering on the
continents.</p>

<p>Water and fire, whose natures appear so
different and so contrary, produce many similar
effects, independent of the particular productions
of these two elements, some of which
bear so striking a resemblance as to be mistaken
for each other, as glass and crystal, natural and
fictitious antimony, &amp;c. There are in nature
an infinity of great effects produced by them,
which are scarcely to be distinguished. Water,
as has been observed, has produced mountains
and formed most islands, while others owe their
origin to fire. There are likewise caverns,
clefts, holes, gulphs, &amp;c. some of which owe
their origin to subterraneous fires, and others
to waters.</p>

<p>Caverns are met with in mountains, and few
or none in plains: there are many in the Archipelago,
and in other islands, because they are
in general only the tops of mountains: caverns
are formed like precipices, by the sinking of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
rocks, or large abysses, by the action of the fire;
for to make a cavern form a precipice or abyss,
we need only suppose the tops of adjacent
rocks had fallen together and formed an arch,
which must often happen when their bottoms
are shaken and dislodged by time or earthquakes.
Caverns may be produced by the same causes
which produce holes, the shaking and sinking
of the earth, and which causes are the explosion
of volcanos, the action of subterraneous vapours
and earthquakes; for they occasion caverns,
holes, and hollows of every kind by their shocks
and commotion.</p>

<p>St. Patrick's cavern in Ireland is not so considerable
as it is famous; it is the same with
the Dog's Grotto in Italy; and that which
throws out fire, in the mountain of Beniguazeval
in the kingdom of Fez. In the county
of Derby, in England, there is a very considerable
cavern, much larger than the famous cavern
of Beauman, near the Black Forest, in
Brunswick. I have been informed by a person
as respectable for his merit as his name, Lord
Morton, that this large cavern, called the
Devil's Hole, at first presents a very considerable
opening, larger than any church door;
that through this opening a rivulet flows;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
that in advancing the vault of the cavern becomes
so low, that persons who are desirous of
continuing their road are obliged to lie flat in
a boat and be pushed through this narrow passage,
where the water almost touches the roof;
but after having passed this part of the vault,
the arch rises to a considerable height, and continues
so for some distance, when it sinks again
so low as to touch the water, and where the
cavern ends. The source of the rivulet which
issues from it sometimes encreases considerably:
it transports and heaps up a great quantity of
sand in one part of the cavern, which is formed
like a kind of alley, whose direction is different
from that of the principal cavern.</p>

<p>In Carniola, near Potpechio, is a very spacious
cavern, in which is a large lake. Near Adelsperg
is a cavern, in which we may travel two
German miles, and where very deep precipices
are to be met with.<a name="FNanchor_AF_32" id="FNanchor_AF_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_AF_32" class="fnanchor">[AF]</a> There are also large
caverns and beautiful grottos under the mountains
of Mendip, in Wales; mines of lead are
found near these caverns, and whole oaks at
fifteen fathoms deep. In the county of Gloucester
there is a very large cavern, called Pen
Park-hole, at the bottom of which there is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
thirty fathoms water, and mines of lead are also
found.</p>

<p>The Devil's Hole, and other caverns, from
whence issue large springs or rivulets, have
plainly therefore been formed by the water,
and their origin cannot be considered as the effects
either of earthquakes or volcanos.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable and largest caverns
known is that of Antiparos, a description
of which is given by M. de Tournefort. We
enter a rustic cavern about thirty feet broad,
divided by some natural pillars; between two of
which, on the right, the ground is on a gentle
slope, and then becomes more steep to the bottom,
about twenty feet; this is the passage to
the grotto, or internal cavern, which is very
dark, and cannot be entered without stooping
and the assistance of torches. We then descend
an horrible precipice by the assistance of a rope,
fastened at the entrance, into another still more
frightful, the borders of which are very slippery,
with dark abysses on the left. By the
assistance of a ladder we pass a perpendicular
rock, and then continue to go through places
somewhat less dangerous: but when we think
ourselves in a safe path, we are stopped short
by a tremendous obstruction, and are obliged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
to crawl on our hands and knees, or slide on our
back, the length of a large rock, and then descend
by a ladder. When we are at the bottom
of the ladder, we still have to stumble over
pieces of rocks for some time, and then we reach
the celebrated grotto. It is computed to be
three hundred fathoms deep from the surface
of the earth, appears to be forty fathoms high
by fifty broad.  It is filled with large beautiful
stalactites of various forms, as well from the
roof of the vault as on the bottom.<a name="FNanchor_AG_33" id="FNanchor_AG_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_AG_33" class="fnanchor">[AG]</a></p>

<p>In part of Greece called Livadia (the Achaia
of the ancients) there is a large cavern in a
mountain which was formerly famous for the
oracles of Trophonius; it is between the lake
Livadia and the adjacent sea; at the nearest part
it is about forty miles; and there are forty subterraneous
passages across the rock, through
which the waters flow.<a name="FNanchor_AH_34" id="FNanchor_AH_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_AH_34" class="fnanchor">[AH]</a></p>

<p>In all countries which produce sulphur,
volcanos, and earthquakes, there are caverns.
The ground of most of the Archipelago islands
is cavernous; the islands of the Indian ocean,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
principally that of the Malacca's, appear to be
supported by vaults and cavities. The land
Azores, the Canaries, the islands of Cape de
Verd, and in general almost every small island,
is in many parts hollow and cavernous; because
these islands are, as we have observed,
only points of mountains where considerable
ebullitions are made, either by the action of
volcanos, of the water, of frosts, or other injuries
of the weather. In the Cordeliers, where
there are many volcanos, and where earthquakes
are frequent, there are also a great number of
caverns.</p>

<p>The famous labyrinth of the island of Candia,
is not the work of nature alone; M. de Tournefort
assures us that it has evidently been greatly
enlarged by men; and most likely this cavern is
not the only one which has been augmented by
human labour. Every day mines and quarries
are digging, and when abandoned for a long
time, it is not easy to discover whether they
have been the productions of nature, or formed
by the hands of men. We know of quarries of
considerable extent; for example that of Maestricht,
where it is said 50,000 men may conceal
themselves, and which is supported by upwards
of 1000 pillars, twenty-four feet high, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
earth and rock above is more than twenty-five
fathoms thick.<a name="FNanchor_AI_35" id="FNanchor_AI_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_AI_35" class="fnanchor">[AI]</a></p>

<p>The salt mines in Poland form still greater
excavations than the above. There are generally
vast quarries near large towns. But we
cannot proceed farther in particulars; besides,
the labour of man, however great, will ever hold
but a small place in the history of nature.</p>

<p>Volcanos and waters which produce caverns
internally, form also external clefts, precipices,
and abysses. At Cajeta, in Italy, there is a
mountain which had formerly been separated
by an earthquake, in a manner so as to appear
as if the division was made by the hands of
men. We have already spoken of the divisions
in the island of Machian, of the abyss of
mount Azarat, of the gap in the Cordeliers, and
that of Thermopyle, &amp;c. To these may be
added, the gap in the mountain of Troglodytes,
in Arabia, which nature only sketched out, and
which Victor Amadeus caused to be finished.
Water as well as subterraneous fires produce
considerable sinking of the earth, fall of rocks,
and overthrow mountains, of which we can
give many examples.</p>

<p>"In the month of June 1714, a part of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
mountain of Diableret, in Valois, fell suddenly,
and some time after, the sky being serene, it
appeared to have taken a conical figure. Fifty-three
huts belonging to the boors were destroyed,
together with several people and a great
many cattle, covering a square league with the
ruins it occasioned. A profound darkness was
caused by the dust; the heaps of stones thrown
together were above thirty perches in height,
stopped the currents of the water, and formed
new and very deep lakes. In all this there was
not the least trace of bitumen, sulphur, lime,
nor consequently any subterraneous fire, and
apparently the base of this great rock was perished
and reduced to dust.<a name="FNanchor_AJ_36" id="FNanchor_AJ_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_AJ_36" class="fnanchor">[AJ]</a>"</p>

<p>We have a remarkable example of these
sinkings near Folkstone, in the county of Kent;
the hills in its environs sunk gradually by an
insensible motion, and without any earthquake.
These hills internally are rocks and chalk, and
by their sinking they have thrown into the sea
rocks and earth which were adjacent to it.
The relation of this fact may be seen in the
Abridgment of the Philosophical Transactions,
vol. VI. page 250.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1618, the town of Pleurs, in Valtelino,
was buried under the rocks, at the bottom of
which it was situated. In 1678, there was a
great inundation in Gascony, caused by the
sinking of some pieces of one of the Pyrennees,
which forced the water to spring forth that
was contained in the subterraneous caverns of
those mountains. In 1680, there happened a
still greater in Ireland, by the sinking of a
mountain into caverns filled with water. We
may easily conceive the cause of these effects.
It is well known there are subterraneous waters
in an infinity of places; these waters carry off
by degrees the sand and earth over which they
pass, consequently may in time destroy the bed
of earth on which the mountain rests; and
this bed of earth being more deficient on one
side than on the other, the mountain of course
must be overthrown; but if this base is worn
every where alike, the mountain will sink and
not be overthrown.</p>

<p>Having remarked on the sinkings and other
changes on the earth, occasioned by what may
be called the accidents of nature, we ought
not to pass over the perpendicular clefts found
throughout the strata of the earth: these clefts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
are perceptible not only in rocks and quarries
of marble and stone, but also in clays and
earths of every kind, which have never been
removed. I call them perpendicular clefts,
because, like the horizontal strata, they are
oblique, by accident only. Woodward and
Ray speak of these clefts, but in a confused
manner; and they do not term them perpendicular
clefts, because they thought they might
be indifferently oblique or perpendicular. No
author has explained the origin of them, although
it is apparent that they have been produced,
as we observed in a preceding article,
by the dryness of the matters which compose
horizontal beds. In whatsoever manner this
drying happens, it must have produced perpendicular
clefts; for the matters which compose
the strata could not have diminished in size
without splitting in a perpendicular direction
to these strata. I comprehend under this name
of perpendicular clefts all natural separations
of rocks, as well as those which may have
been occasioned by any convulsive accident.
When some considerable motion happens to
masses of rocks, these clefts are sometimes
found obliquely placed, but this is because the
mass is of itself oblique, and with a little attention
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
it is always easy to discover that these
clefts are in general perpendicular to the horizontal
strata, particularly in quarries of marble,
lime, stones, and all large chains of rocks.</p>

<p>Mountains internally are principally composed
of stone and rocks in parallel beds: between
the horizontal beds small strata of a softer
matter than stone is found, and the perpendicular
clefts are filled with sand, crystals, minerals,
metals, &amp;c. these last matters are of a
more modern formation than the horizontal
beds in which we find sea-shells. The rains have
by degrees loosened the sand and the earth on
the upper parts of mountains, and have left
the stone and rocks entirely naked, in which
we readily distinguish the horizontal strata and
perpendicular clefts: in plains, on the contrary,
the rain-water and flood having brought
a considerable quantity of earth, sand, gravel,
and other such matters, have formed a bed of
tufa, soft and dissoluble stone, sand, gravel, and
earth, mixed with vegetables. These beds contain
no marine shells, or at least only fragments,
which have been detached from mountains,
with gravel and earth. We must carefully
distinguish these new beds from the old,
where almost always a great number of entire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
shells are found placed in their natural situation.</p>

<p>If we observe the order and internal disposition
of matters in a mountain, composed, for
example, of common stones, or calcinable lapidific
matters, we generally find a bed of gravel
under the vegetable earth, of the nature and
colour of the stone which predominates in
this ground; and under the gravel we meet
with stone. When the mountain is divided
by some trench, or deep cut, we easily distinguish
all the strata of which it is composed.
Each horizontal stratum is separated by a kind
of joint, which is likewise horizontal, and their
thickness generally increase in proportion as
they lower from the summit of the mountain,
and are all divided vertically by perpendicular
clefts. In common, the first stratum which
is met with under the gravel, and even the
second, are only thinner than the beds which
form the base of the mountain, but are so
divided by perpendicular clefts, that pieces of
any length are not to be seen: they perfectly
resemble the cracks of ground which is very
dry, but go not very far, gradually disappearing
in proportion as they descend, and towards the
bottom there are no great number but where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
they divide the strata in a more regular manner.
These beds of stone are often many leagues
in extent, without any interruption; we almost
always meet with the same kind of stone in the
opposite mountains, whether divided by a small
neck or a valley; and the beds of stone disappear
only in places where the mountain sinks
and becomes level with some large plain.
Sometimes, between the first stratum of vegetable
earth and that of gravel, marl is found,
which communicates its colour and other qualities
to the other two: then the perpendicular
clefts of the quarries which are beneath are
filled with this marl, where it acquires an
hardness in appearance equal to that of stone,
but by exposing it to the air it crumbles, softens
and becomes ductile.</p>

<p>In most quarries the beds of stone formed on
the summit of a mountain are soft, and those
near the base are hard; the first is commonly
white, of so fine a grain as scarcely to be perceived;
it becomes more grained and harder in
proportion as it descends, and the lowest stone
is not only harder than that of the upper, but
it is also closer, more compact and heavier its
grain is fine and glossy, and often brittle, and
breaks as clear as flint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>The interior part of a mountain is therefore
composed of different beds of stone, the upper
of which are of soft stone and the lower of
hard, and much broader at the bottom than at
the top; which indeed almost necessarily follows,
for, as they become so much the harder as they
descend, it may be fairly supposed that the currents
and other motions of the water which have
hollowed the vallies and given a shape to the
turnings of a mountain, will have laterally
worked on the matters of which the mountain
is composed, and have worn them away in proportion
as they were hard or soft. Now the
upper strata being the softest, it will naturally
have suffered the greatest diminution. This is
one of the causes to which the inclination of
mountains may be attributed, and this inclination
will be still less steep in proportion as the
earth and gravel have been washed away by the
rain; and for these reasons it is, that hills and
mountains composed of calcinable matters, have
an inclination much less than those composed of
live rock and flint in large masses; the last in
general are of considerable heights and nearly
perpendicular, because, in these masses of vitrifiable
matters, the upper beds, as well as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
lower, are of great hardness, and have alike resisted
the action of the waters.</p>

<p>When on the top of a hill, whose summit is
flat, and of a pretty large extent, we meet with
hard stone directly under the stratum of vegetable
earth, we must remark, that what appears
to be the summit, is not so in fact, but only the
continuation of some higher hill, whose upper
strata are soft stone and the lower hard; and it is
the prolongation of these last strata that we
meet with again at the top of the first hill.</p>

<p>On the summit of mountains which are not
surmounted by any considerable height it is generally
only soft stone, and we must dig very
deep to meet with hard. Banks of marble are
never found but between these beds of hard
stone, which are diversely coloured by the metallic
earths which the rain introduces into the
strata by filtration, and possibly in every country
where there is stone, marble would be found
if dug for to a sufficient depth; <i>Quoto enim loco
non suum marmor invenitur?</i> says Pliny. In
fact it is a much more common stone than it is
thought to be, and differs from other stones
only by the fineness of its grain, which renders
it more compact and susceptible of a brilliant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
polish; and from which quality it took its denomination
from the ancients.</p>

<p>The perpendicular fissures and joints of quarries
are often filled and incrusted with concretions,
which are sometimes as transparent as
crystal, of a regular figure, sometimes opaque:
the water flows through the perpendicular clefts,
and penetrates even the compact texture of the
stone; the stones which are porous, imbibe so
great a quantity of water, that the frost splits
and divides them. The rain by filtrating through
the beds of marle, stone, and marble, load
themselves with every matter they can take up
or dissolve. These waters at first run along the
perpendicular clefts, afterwards penetrate the
beds of stone, and deposit between the horizontal
joints, as well as in the perpendicular
clefts, the matters they have brought with them,
and form these different congelations according
to the nature of the matters they have deposited;
for example, when the water filters through
marle, chalk, or soft stone, the matters which
they deposit are a very pure and fine marle,
which generally enters in the perpendicular cleft
of the rocks under the form of a porous, soft
substance, commonly very white and light,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
which naturalists have called <i>Lac lunac</i>, or <i>Medulla
Saxi</i>.</p>

<p>When these streams of water, loaded with
lapidific matter, flow through the horizontal
joints of soft stone or chalk, this matter attaches
itself to the surface of the blocks of stone, and
forms white, scaly, light, and spongy crust;
which some authors have named <i>Mineral Agaric</i>,
from its resemblance to Vegetable Agaric: but
if the strata are of common hard stone, proper to
make good lime, the filter being then more close,
the water will issue from it loaded with lapidific
matter, more pure and homogeneous, and whose
molecules uniting more intimately, will form
nearly concretions of the hardness of stone,
with a little transparency, and we shall find on
the surfaces of the blocks in these quarries,
stony incrustations variously disposed, which
entirely fill up the horizontal joints.</p>

<p>In grottos and cavities of rocks, which may
be looked upon as the basons of perpendicular
clefts, the diverted direction of the streams of
water, give different forms to the concretion
which result therefrom. They in general have
the appearance of a cone attached to the top of
the vault, although they may more properly be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
considered as hollow and white cylinders, formed
by a concentrical surface; these congelations
sometimes descend, by drops, to the bottom,
and form pillars, and a thousand other figures,
as uncouth and ridiculous as the names which
naturalists have been pleased to give them, such
as, <i>Stalactites</i>, <i>Stelegmites</i>, <i>Osleocollae</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>When these concretic juices issue immediately
from marble and hard stone, the lapidific matter
conveyed by the water being rather dissolved
than loosened, the small constituent parts take
a regular figure, and form columns, terminated
by triangular points, which are transparent and
consist of oblique strata; this is called Spar,
or Spall. It is generally transparent and colourless,
but when the stone or marble, from whence
it issues, contains metallic parts, this spar is as
hard as stone; it dissolves, like stone, by acid
spirits, and calcines with the same heat; therefore
we cannot doubt that it is real stone, and
perfectly homogeneous. It might even be said
that it is a pure and elementary stone, under its
proper and specific form.</p>

<p>Most naturalists nevertheless look on this
matter as a direct substance, existing independent
of stone; it is the lapidific or crystalline
juice which, according to them, not only binds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the parts of common stone, but even those of
flint. This juice, say they, constantly augments
the density of stones by reiterated filtrations,
and at length converts them into real
flint. When this juice is fixed in spar, it continues
to receive still more pure juices, which
increase its density and hardness, so that this
matter successively becomes glass, then crystal,
and at last a perfect diamond.</p>

<p>But if this is true, why, in whole provinces,
does this crystalline juice form only stone, and
in others nothing but flint? Will they say,
that the two soils are not of a like age, and
that this juice has not had time to circulate and
complete the end of its natural action? This
is not probable. Besides, from whence does
this juice proceed? If it produces stone and
flints, what is it that produces this juice? It is
apparent that it has no existence independent of
these matters, which of themselves can give to
the water that penetrates them a petrifying
quality, always relative to their native and specific
character; insomuch that when it filtrates
through stones it forms spar, and when it issues
from flints, crystal: and there are as many different
kinds of this juice, as matters from which
they proceed. Experience perfectly agrees with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
this idea. The waters which filtrate through
stone quarries, generally form soft and calcinable
matters like the stones themselves; on the contrary,
those which spring from rock and flint
form hard and vitrifiable congelations, which
have all the other properties of flint, as the first
have all those of stone; so the waters which have
penetrated the beds of mineral and metallic substances
produce pyrites, marcasites, and grains.</p>

<p>We have observed, that we might divide all
matters into two great classes, vitrifiable and
calcinable; clay and flint, marle and stone,
may be looked upon as the two extremes of
each of these classes, the intervals of which are
filled with an almost infinite variety of the mixt
matters that have always one or other of these
substances for their basis.</p>

<p>The substances of the first class can never
acquire the nature and properties of the other.
Stone will always be as remote from the nature
of flint, as potters earth is from marle; no
known agent will ever be capable of making
them quit the combinations peculiar to their nature:
the country which produces stone and
marble will remain to do so as certainly as those
wherein there is only flint and granate will never
have either stone or marble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>If we observe the order and distribution of
matters in a hill composed of vitrifiable matters,
we shall commonly find, under the first bed of
vegetable earth, a bed of clay, a vitrifiable
matter, analogous to flint, and which, as I have
observed, is only a decomposed vitrifiable sand:
this bed of argilaceous earth or sand answers to
a bed of gravel met with in hills composed of
calcinable matters: beneath which we meet
with some beds of free-stone scarcely ever more
than six inches thick, and divided into small
pieces by perpendicular clefts. Under these beds
are many others of the same matters, and also
beds of vitrifiable sand, the free-stone becomes
harder and its blocks encrease in size in proportion
as we descend; underneath these we find a
very hard matter which I have called live rock,
or flint in large masses, which is so hard as to
resist the file, graver, and acid spirits, more than
vitrifiable sand, and even powdered glass, on
which aqua-fortis seems to have some effect. If
struck by another hard body it emits sparks, and
exhales a very penetrating smell of sulphur.
This massy flint, as I have termed it, is generally
found with beds of clay, earth, coals, and vitrifiable
sand, answers to the strata of hard stone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
and marbles, which serve as a base to hills composed
of calcinable matters.</p>

<p>Water, by flowing through perpendicular
clefts, and by penetrating the strata of these
vitrifiable sands, clays, and earths, becomes impregnated
with the fine and most homogeneous
parts of these matters, and forms many different
concretions, such as talcs, amianthus's, and various
other substances produced by distillations
through vitrifiable matters.</p>

<p>Flint, notwithstanding its hardness and density,
has, like common marble and hard stone,
its exudations, from whence stalactites of different
kinds result, whose varieties of transparency,
colours and configuration, are according
to the nature of the flint which produces them,
and the different metallic or heterogeneous
matters which it contains. Rock crystal, all
precious stones, white or coloured, and even
diamonds, may be regarded as stalactites of
this kind. Flints in small pieces, whose strata
are generally concentric, are also stalactites, or
parasitical stones; from flints of large dimensions,
and most fine opaque stones, are only species
of flint. Matters of a vitrifiable kind, as
we have observed, do not produce so great a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
variety of concretions as those of the calcinable
class; and these concretions, produced by flints,
are almost all hard and precious stones; whereas
those of the calcareous are only soft matters of
no value.</p>

<p>Perpendicular clefts are found in rocks of
flint, as well as in those of marble and hard
stone; they are sometimes even larger there,
which proves that matter is still dryer than
stone: hills, whether of calcinable or vitrifiable
matters, are supported by clay or vitrifiable sand;
these are the common and general matters of
which the globe is composed, and which I look
on as the lightest parts, or the scoria of vitrified
matter, with which it is internally filled;
thus all mountains or plains have argilaceous
earth or sand for their common foundation.
For example, we see that in the pits at Amsterdam
and Marly la Ville, vitrifiable sand was
below every other stratum.</p>

<p>In most naked rocks it is observable that the
sides of the perpendicular clefts, whether broad
or narrow, correspond as exactly as those of a
piece of slit wood. In the large quarries in
Arabia, which are almost composed of granate,
these perpendicular separations are very frequent;
and although some are twenty or thirty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
yards wide, yet the ridges exactly correspond
and leave a deep cavity between them.<a name="FNanchor_AK_37" id="FNanchor_AK_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_AK_37" class="fnanchor">[AK]</a> It is
very common to find in perpendicular clefts
shells broken in half, and each piece remaining
fastened to the stone on the opposite side; which
proves these shells were placed in the solid stratum,
and before the cleft was made.<a name="FNanchor_AL_38" id="FNanchor_AL_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_AL_38" class="fnanchor">[AL]</a></p>

<p>In some matters the perpendicular clefts are
very wide, as in the quarries quoted by Shaw,
which perhaps is the reason that they are not
so frequently met with. In the quarries of
flint and granate, the stone may be cut out in
very large pieces without the smallest inconveniency,
as the obelisks and pillars seen at
Rome, which are upwards of sixty, eighty, an
hundred, or one hundred and fifty feet long.
It appears that these large pillars were raised
from the quarry, and that they are to be had of
any required thickness, as well as some species
of free-stone. There are other matters where
these perpendicular strata are very narrow; as
in clay, marl, and chalk, and they are wider
in marble and most hard stones. Some are
imperceptible from being filled with a matter
nearly similar to that of the stone itself, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
nevertheless breaks off the continuity of the
stone, and are what the workmen call hairs. I
have often remarked that in marble and stone
these hairs cross the blocks entirely, and differ
from particular clefts only because their separation
is not complete; these kind of clefts are
filled with a transparent matter, which is a
true spar. There are a great number of considerable
clefts in the quarries of free-stone;
this proceeds from these rocks often resting
on less solid bases than marble or calcinable
stones, which generally rest on clay. There
are many places where free-stone is not to
be met with in large masses; and in most
quarries where it is good it lies in the form of
cubes and parallel pipedes placed on each
other in a very irregular manner, as in the hills
of Fontainbleau, which at a distance appear
to be the ruins of ancient buildings. This irregular
disposition proceeds from the base of
these hills being composed of sand, which permits
the rocks to sink one on the other, particularly
in places that formerly have been
worked, which has occasioned a great number
of clefts and intervals between the blocks; and
we may observe, in every country where sand
and free-stone abound, that there are many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
pieces of rock and large stones in the middle
of plains and vallies; whereas in a country
consisting chiefly of marble and hard stone,
these scattered pieces, which have rolled from
the hills and mountains, are very scarce, which
proceeds only from the different solidity of the
base on which these stones rest, and from the
extent of the banks of marble and calcinable
stone, which is more considerable than that of
free-stone.</p>

<p class="caption3">OF THE EFFECTS OF RAIN&mdash;OF MARSHES, SUBTERRANEOUS
WOOD, AND WATER.</p>


<p>We have already observed that rains, and
the currents of water they produce,
continually detach from the heights of mountains
sand, earth, gravel, &amp;c. which they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
carry into plains, from whence the rivers convey
a part of them into the sea. Plains therefore
are successively filled, and by degrees raised
higher, while mountains daily diminish.
Joseph Blancanus relates various facts on this
subject, which were of public notoriety in his
time, and which prove that mountains have
been considerably lowered. In the county of
Derby, in England, the steeple of the village
Craich was not visible in 1572 from a certain
mountain, on account of the height of
another which intervened; in eighty or an
hundred years after, not only this steeple but
every part of the church became visible from
that very spot. Dr. Plot gives a similar example
of a mountain between Sibbertoft and
Ashby, in Northamptonshire. The rain waters
not only carry with them the lightest parts
of the mountains, as earth, gravel, and small
stones, but even undermine and roll down large
rocks, which considerably diminish the height
of them. The mountains of Wales are very
steep and high, and the fragments of these
rocks are to be seen in large pieces at their
feet, which as well as all fragments of rocks
met with in vallies are the works of frosts and
water. It is not mountains of sand and earth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
alone which the rain causes to sink, for they
attack the hardest rocks, and carry with them
large fragments into the vallies. In a valley
in Nant-phrancon, in 1685, a part of a large
rock, which rested on a narrow base, having
been undermined by the waters, fell and broke
in many pieces, the largest of which, in descending,
tore up a considerable trench in the
plain, and crossed a small river on the other
side of which it stopped. It is to similar accidents
we must attribute the origin of all the
large stones found adjacent to the mountains.
We must recollect, as before observed, that
these large stones, scattered abroad, are more
common in countries whose mountains are
composed of sand and free-stone, than in those
where their composition is marble and clay,
because sand is a less solid foundation than
clay.</p>

<p>To give an idea of the quantity of earth
which the rain detaches from mountains and
carries into the vallies, we shall quote a circumstance
related by Dr. Plot; he says, in his
Natural History of Staffordshire, that 18 feet
deep in the earth a great number of pieces of
money had been found, coined in the reign
of Edward IV. two hundred years before his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
time, from which he concludes that the ground
which is marshy has increased above a foot in
eleven years, or an inch and a twelfth every
year. A similar observation occurs with respect
to some trees buried seventeen feet deep
from the surface under which medals of Julius
Cæsar were found; so the earth, brought from
the top of mountains by the waters, considerably
increases the elevation of the ground of
plains.</p>

<p>This gravel, sand, and earth which the
waters from mountains convey into plains
form strata, which must not be confounded
with the ancient and original strata of the
globe. In the former class must be placed
those of soft stone, gravel, and sand, the grains
of which are washed and rounded; to these
may be added, the strata of stones which are
formed by a kind of incrustation; neither
of which owe their origin to the motion or
sediments of the sea. In these strata of soft
and imperfect stones are found an infinity of
vegetables, leaves, land and river shells, and
small bones of terrestrial animals, but never
sea shells, or other marine productions; which
evidently proves, together with their want of
solidity, that these strata are formed on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
surface of the dry land; and that they are more
modern than those of marble and other stones
which contain shells, and were originally
formed by the sea. All these modern stones
appear to be hard and solid when they are first
hewn out, but when, exposed to the weather,
the air and rain presently dissolve them; their
substance is so different from true stone, that
when reduced into minute parts, to make sand
of them, they are converted into a kind of earth
or clay. Stalactites, and other stony concretions,
which Tournefort took for vegetated
marble, are not real stones, no more than those
formed by the incrustations. We have already
shewn that tufa is not of ancient formation, and
must not be ranked in the class of stones.
Tufa is an imperfect matter, differing from
stone or earth, but which derives its origin
from both by the means of rain water, as incrustations
derive theirs from the deposit of the
water of certain springs; therefore the strata
of these matters are not ancient, nor been
formed like the rest, by the sediments of the
sea. The strata of turf are also modern, and
have been produced by the successive assemblage
of leaves and other perishable vegetables,
and which are only preserved by a bitumous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
earth. Among these modern strata we never
meet with any marine production; but, on
the contrary, many vegetables, bones of land
animals, and land and river shells, as may be
seen in the meadows, near Ashby, in the county
of Northampton, where a great number of snail
shells, plants, herbs, and many river shells are
found all in good preservation, some feet deep
in the earth, but not a single marine shell among
them.<a name="FNanchor_AM_39" id="FNanchor_AM_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_AM_39" class="fnanchor">[AM]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_AM_39" id="Footnote_AM_39"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AM_39"><span class="label">[AM]</span></a> See Philosophical Trans. Abridg. XI. page 271.</p></div>

<p>These new strata have been formed by the
water which runs on the surface of the earth,
often changing situation and dispersing on
every side. Part of these waters penetrate
internally and flow across the clefts of rocks
and stones; and the reason we meet with no
water in high lands, no more than on the tops
of hills, is, because all elevations are generally
composed of stone and rocks, therefore to find
water we must dig through the rock till we
come to clay, or firm earth, on which these
rocks stand, and we shall not meet with any
water until the stone is pierced to the bottom:
therefore, when the thickness of the rock,
which must be pierced, is very considerable, as
in lofty mountains, where they are often upwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
of 1000 feet in height, it is impossible to
dig to their base, and of course to have any
water. There are even large parts of land
where there is not any water, as in Arabia
Petrea, which is a desert where no rain ever
falls, where the scorching sand covers the whole
surface of the earth, where there is scarcely
any vegetable soil, where the few plants found
are sickly, and where springs and wells are so
very scarce that only five are reckoned between
Cairo and Mount Sinai, and the water of them
is salt and bitter.</p>

<p>When the waters on the surface cannot find
vent to flow they form marshes and fens. The
most famous marshes in Europe are those of
Muscovy, at the source of the Tanais; and
those of Savolaxia and Enasak, in Finland;
there are also some in Holland, Westphalia,
and other low countries: in Asia are the marshes
of the Euphrates, of Tartary, and of the Palus
Meotis; nevertheless there are fewer of them
in Asia and Africa than in Europe but America
may be said to be but one continued marsh
throughout all its plains, which is a greater proof
of the modern date of the country, and of the
small number of inhabitants than of their want
of industry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>There are very great bogs in England,
especially near the sea in Lincolnshire, which
has lost much ground on one side and gained
it on the other. In the ancient ground a great
number of trees are found buried below the
new ground, which has been deposited there
by the water. The same also are met with in
Scotland, particularly at the mouth of the river
Ness. Near Bruges, in Flanders, in digging
to the depth of 40 or 50 feet, a great quantity
of trees were found, as close to each other as
in a forest: the trunks, branches, and leaves,
were so well preserved that the different kinds
were easily distinguished. About 500 years
since, the land where these trees were found
was covered by the sea, and before that time
there is no trace or tradition that it ever existed;
nevertheless it must have been so, when
these trees stood and vegetated; therefore this
ground, which formerly was covered with
wood, has been overwhelmed by the sea, the
waters of which has, by degrees, deposited
there between 40 and 50 feet of earth upon the
former surface, and then retired. A number
of subterraneous trees have been also found
at Youle, in Yorkshire, 12 miles below the
town, near the river Humber; there are some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
large enough for building; and it is said, perhaps
improperly, that this wood is as durable
as oak. The people cut them into long thin
slips, and sell them in the neighbouring towns,
where they are used for lighting of pipes. All
these trees appear broken, and the trunks are
separated from the roots as if they had suffered
the violence of a hurricane, or an inundation.
This wood greatly resembles willow, it has the
same smell when burnt, and makes charcoal
exactly like it.<a name="FNanchor_AN_40" id="FNanchor_AN_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_AN_40" class="fnanchor">[AN]</a> In the Isle of Man there is
a marsh six miles long by three broad, it is
called Curragh; subterraneous trees, like willows,
are found there, and although they are
18 or 20 feet high, they are, nevertheless, firm
on their roots.<a name="FNanchor_AO_41" id="FNanchor_AO_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_AO_41" class="fnanchor">[AO]</a> Trees are met with in almost
every morass, bog, and marsh, in Somerset,
Chester, Lancaster, and Stafford. There are
some places where trees are found under the
earth, which have been cut, sawed, squared,
and worked by the labour of man; and even
wedges and saws have likewise been found
by them. Between Birmingham and Bromley,
in the county of Lincoln, there are lofty hills
of fine light sand, which the rain and wind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
sweep away, leaving uncovered the roots of
large willow trees, on which the impression of
the axe is exceedingly plain. These hills, without
doubt, have been formed like downs, by
the accumulation of sand, which the waters of
the sea has brought there and deposited at different
periods. A great number of these subterraneous
trees are also found in the marshy
lands of Holland, Friesland, and near Groningen,
from whence the turfs which they burn
are dug.</p>

<p>In the earth are found trees of almost every
kind, as willows, oaks, firs, aspins, beach, yew,
ash, hawthorn, &amp;c. In the fens of Lincoln,
along the river Ouse, and in Hatfield-Chace, in
the county of York, these trees are as straight
as we see them in a forest. The oaks are very
hard and used in buildings; they are said to last
a long time, but which I must doubt, as all
trees that are dug out of the earth, at least all
those which I have seen, whether oak or others,
lose, in drying, all the solidity, which they appeared
to have at first. The ash is tender,
and soon crumbles to dust. There are many
trees which have clearly been shaped and
sawed by men, and the hatchets, sometimes
found near them, resemble, in form, the knives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
anciently used in sacrifices. Besides trees, nuts,
acorns, &amp;c. are met with in great quantities, in
many other fenny parts of England and Ireland,
as well as the morasses of France, Sweden, Savoy,
and Italy.<a name="FNanchor_AP_42" id="FNanchor_AP_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_AP_42" class="fnanchor">[AP]</a></p>

<p>In the city of Modena, and four miles round,
whatever part of the earth is dug, to the depth
of sixty-three feet, and then bored five more
with an auger, the water springs out with such
great force, that the well is filled instantly; and
this water continues always the same, neither
diminishing nor increasing by rain nor draught.
What is more remarkable in this ground,
when we reach the depth of fourteen feet, we
find the ruins of an ancient town, as paved
streets, houses, different pieces of mosaic work,
&amp;c. After this is a very solid ground, which
appears to have never been stirred; yet below it
we find a moist earth mixed with vegetables;
and at twenty-six feet entire trees, as filberds
with nuts thereon, and a great quantity of
branches and leaves. At twenty-eight feet is a
stratum of chalk mixed with shells, and this
bed is eleven feet in thickness; after this we
again meet with vegetables; and so on alternatively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
to the depth of sixty-three, feet, when
there is a bed of sand mixed with gravel and
shells, like those formed on the coasts of the
Italian sea; these successive beds are always
met with in the same order, wheresoever it has
been dug, and very often the auger meets with
large trunks of trees, which the workmen bore
through with much labour. Bones of animals,
coals, flint, and pieces of iron are also found.
Ramazzini, who relates these circumstances,
thinks that the gulph of Venice formerly extended
beyond Modena, and, that by the sediments of
rivers in the course of time, assisted perhaps by
the inundations of the sea, this ground has been
formed.</p>

<p>I shall no longer dwell on the varieties in the
formation of modern strata, it suffices to have
shewn that they have been produced by no other
causes than the running and stagnate waters,
which are upon the surface of the earth, and
that they are neither so hard nor solid as the
ancient strata which are formed under the waters
of the sea.</p>

<p class="caption3">OF THE CHANGES OF LAND INTO SEA AND SEA
INTO LAND.</p>


<p>By what has been said in the Articles <span class="smcap">I</span>, <span class="smcap">VII</span>,
<span class="smcap">VIII</span>, and <span class="smcap">IX</span>, it appears that great and general
changes have happened to the terrestrial
globe; and it is as certain, from what we have
related in other articles, that the surface of the
earth has undergone particular alterations. Although
the order, or succession, of these particular
alterations is not perfectly known, yet
we are acquainted with the principal causes; we
can even distinguish their different effects; and
if we could collect all the facts, which Natural
and Civil History furnishes on the subject of
the revolutions which have happened to the surface
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
of the earth, we do not doubt but that the
Theory of the Earth which we have, laid down
would receive additional support.</p>

<p>One of the principal causes of these alterations
is the motion of the sea; a motion it has
endured from the earliest ages; for since the
sun, moon, earth, waters, air, &amp;c. have existed
from the time of the creation, the effects of the
tides, the motion of the sea from east to west,
as well as that of the winds and currents, must
have been felt for the same space; and if even
we should suppose the axis of the globe had
formerly another inclination, and that the continents,
as well as the sea, had another disposition,
it does not destroy the motion of flux and
reflux, nor alter the cause and effects of the
winds: it is sufficient that the immense quantity
of waters, which fill the vast space of the sea,
is found in some part on the globe of the earth,
for wherever they had been collected they would
have still been subject to the same motions, and
produced similar effects.</p>

<p>When it was once supposed that our continent
was formerly the bottom of the sea, there was
soon no doubt remaining thereon. The devastations
of the sea, which are every where to
be met with; the horizontal situation of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
strata of the earth; and the correspondence of
hills and mountains, appear as so many convincing
proofs; for by examining the plains,
vallies, and hills, we clearly perceive that the
surface of the earth has been formed by the waters.
It is equally evident, when we look into
the interior parts of the earth, that those stones
which contain sea-shells, have been formed by
the sediments of the waters, since the shells are
found filled with the same matter as that which
surrounds them; and lastly, by reflecting on the
corresponding angles of opposite hills, we cannot
doubt that their directions are the works
of the currents of the sea. It is true, that since
the earth has been left uncovered, the original
form of the surface has been constantly changing;
the mountains have diminished in height;
the plains have been elevated; the angles of
hills become more obtuse; many matters washed
away by floods, or rivers, have taken a
round shape; beds of gravel, soft stone, &amp;c.
have been formed; but the essential matter is
still remaining, the ancient form is still apparent,
and I am persuaded that all the world may
be convinced by their own inspection of what
has been advanced on this subject; and whoever
attends to the observations and proofs I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
have given, will not doubt, the earth was formerly
covered by the waters of the sea, and that
it is the currents of the sea which have given to
the surface of the earth, the form we at present
perceive.</p>

<p>The principal motion of the sea is, as we
have already observed, from east to west. It
also appears that the sea has gained above 500
leagues of ground on the eastern coasts of both
the old and new continents; for the proofs of
which we refer to those given in <a href="#ARTICLE_XI">Article XI</a>. and
shall only add thereto, that all straits which
join two seas, are directed from east to west; the
straits of Magellan, Frobisher, of Hudson, of
Ceylon, and those of the seas of Corea and
Kamtschatka have all this direction, and appear
to have been formed by the currents of the
waters, which being impelled from east to west,
opened these passages in the same direction, and
in which they preserve a more considerable motion
than in any other; for in these straits there
are high and violent tides, whereas in those
situated on the western coasts, like that of Gibraltar,
Sund, &amp;c. the motion of the tides is
almost insensible.</p>

<p>The inequalities of the bottom of the sea
change the direction of the water's motion;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
they have been successively produced by the
sediments of the water, and by matters transported
by the tides or other motions; for we
do not consider the motion of the tides as the
sole cause of those inequalities, but only as the
principal and first, because it is the most constant
and acts without interruption; the action of
the winds is another cause; the action of which
beginning at the surface, extends to considerable
depths, as is plain from the matters that are
loosened and thrown up by a storm from the
bottom of the sea, and which never happens but
in tempestuous weather.</p>

<p>We have already mentioned that between the
tropics, and even some degrees beyond them,
an east wind continually blows; this wind,
which contributes to the general motion of the
sea from east to west, is as ancient as the flux
and reflux, since it depends on the rarefaction of
the air, produced by the heat of the sun. Here
then are two united causes of motion, the greatest
of which is near the equator. The first, the
tides which are more sensibly felt in southern latitudes:
and the second, the east wind which
blows continually in the same climates. These
two causes have concurred, ever since the formation
of the globe, to produce a motion in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
waters from east to west, and to agitate them
more in that part of the globe than in all the
rest. It is for this reason that the greatest inequalities
of the surface of the globe are found
between the tropics. The part of Africa, comprehended
between these two circles, is only
a group of mountains whose different chains
extend for the most part from east to west, as is
evident from the direction of the great rivers of
this part of the world; it is the same with those
parts of Asia and America which are comprised
between the tropics.</p>

<p>From the combination of the general motion
of the sea from east to west, with the flux and
reflux of the currents, and the winds, an infinite
number of different effects has resulted,
both on the bottom of the sea, and on the coasts.
Varenius says, it is very probable that the gulphs
and straits have been formed by the reiterated
efforts of the ocean against the land; that the
Mediterranean sea, the gulphs of Arabia, Bengal,
and Cambay, have been formed by the
eruption of the waters, as well as the straits
between Sicily and Italy, between Ceylon and
India, between Greece and Eub&#339;a, and that
it is the same with respect to the straits of the
Manillas, Magellan, &amp;c. that one proof of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
these eruptions, and that the sea has forsaken
different lands is, that but few islands are to be
met with in the great seas, and never a great
number of islands close to each other; that in
the immense space occupied by the Pacific sea,
not above two or three small islands are to be
found towards the middle of it; that in the vast
Atlantic ocean, between Africa and the Brazils,
we only find the small islands of St. Helena and
Ascension; but that all islands are near the great
continents, as those of the Archipelago, near the
continents of Europe and Asia, the Canaries,
near Africa, all the islands of the Indian sea,
near the eastern coast of Asia; the Antille
islands, close to that of America, and that only
the Azores lie at any great distance in the sea
between Europe and America.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Ceylon say, that their
island was separated from the peninsula of India
by an eruption of the ocean; and this popular
tradition is very probable. It is also imagined
the island of Sumatra has been separated from
the continent, and the great number of shoals
and sand banks are a strong proof of it. The
Malabars assert, that the Maldivian islands
formed a part of the continent of India, and in
general it may be reasonably supposed that all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
eastern islands have been divided from the continents
by eruptions of the ocean.<a name="FNanchor_AQ_43" id="FNanchor_AQ_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_AQ_43" class="fnanchor">[AQ]</a></p>

<p>There is an appearance that formerly the
island of Great Britain was part of the continent,
and that England was joined to France;
the similarity of the stones on the two coasts,
and the narrowness of this strait seem plainly
to indicate it. By supposing, says Dr. Wallis,
"that England formerly communicated with
France, by an isthmus between Dover and Calais,
it must follow that the sea would be carried
against both sides of it with great violence
by the tides twice in every twenty-four hours,
the German ocean, which is between England
and Holland, striking of it on the eastern
side, and that of France on the west, would
be sufficient in time to wear away so narrow
a neck of land, as we have supposed. The tides
acting with great violence, not only against this
isthmus but also against the coasts of France and
England, must have washed away a great quantity
of sand, earth, and clay, from every part
against which the sea was forced: but, being stopt
in its course, it would not deposite, as might
be supposed, their sediments against this isthmus,
but transported them into the great plain that now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
forms Romney Marsh, which is eight miles long
by four broad; for whosoever has seen this plain,
cannot doubt but that it was formerly covered
with the sea, as it would be still overflowed
by spring tides if it was not for the Dikes of
Dimchurch."</p>

<p>The German sea must have acted in the
same manner against this isthmus, and the
coasts of England and Flanders would convey
its sediments into Holland and Zealand,
the ground of which, though formerly covered
with water, is now forty feet above. On the
coast of England, the German sea must have
filled up that large valley, where the river
Stour actually flows for more than 20 miles,
beginning at Sandwich, passing Canterbury,
Chatham, Chilham as far as Ashford. At this
place the ground is much higher than it
was formerly, since at Chatham the bones of an
hippopotamus were found seventeen feet deep
in the earth, together with anchors and marine
shells.</p>

<p>It is very probable the sea may form new
land, by bringing and depositing, at particular
places, sand, earth, mud, &amp;c. for in the island
of Orkney, which is adjacent to Romney
Marsh, there was a tract of low land continually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
in danger of being inundated by the river
Rother; but in less than 60 years this ground
has been considerably elevated by quantities
of earth and mud being brought thither every
tide, and the channel through which it enters,
in less than fifty years has deepened so much as
to admit of the reception of large vessels, whereas
at that time it was a ford over which people
might pass.</p>

<p>In this manner, the sand bank was formed
which extends obliquely from the coast of
Norfolk to that of Zealand. This bank
forms that part where the tides of the German
and French sea meet, since the isthmus has been
broken, and where the earth and sand are deposited
which are washed away from the coasts;
nor is it by any means improbable but that in
the course of time this bank may become an
isthmus.<a name="FNanchor_AR_44" id="FNanchor_AR_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_AR_44" class="fnanchor">[AR]</a></p>

<p>There is a great appearance, says Ray, that
the island of Great Britain was formerly joined
to France, and formed part of that continent:
but it is not known whether its separation was
caused by an earthquake, an eruption of the
ocean, or by the labour of man; but that this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
island formed part of the continent is evident,
from the rocks and coasts of both being of
the same nature, composed of the same matters,
and exactly of the same height; the length of
the rocks, along these coasts, are also nearly
the same, about six miles on either side. The
little breadth of the channel, which in this
part is not more than twenty-four English
miles, and its shallowness, comparatively with
the neighbouring sea, is another reason to
suppose that England has been divided from
France by accident. We may add to these
proofs, that there were formerly wolves and
bears in this island; it is not to be presumed
that they could swim over, nor that men transported
such destructive animals; for in general
we find the noxious animals of the continent in
the adjacent islands, and never in those which
are separated from them by a great distance;
as the Spaniards remarked when they landed in
America.<a name="FNanchor_AS_45" id="FNanchor_AS_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_AS_45" class="fnanchor">[AS]</a></p>

<p>In the reign of Henry I. King of England,
a great inundation happened by an eruption of
the sea in part of Flanders. In 1446 by a
like eruption 10,000 persons were drowned in
the territory of Dordrecht, and more than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
100,000 round Dullart, Friezeland, and in
Zealand. In these last two provinces upwards
of 300 villages were overflowed; the tops of
their towers and steeples are still to be seen
rising out of the water.</p>

<p>From the coasts of France, England, Holland
and Germany, the sea has retreated in
many parts. Hubert Thomas relates, in his
description of Liege, that the sea formerly surrounded
the walls of the city of Tongres,
which is now more than 35 leagues distant
from it; this he proves by many eligible reasons,
and, among others, he says; that in his
time the iron rings, to which the ships were
moored, were to be seen remaining in the
walls. We may likewise look on as lands deserted
by the sea, the fens of Lincoln in England,
Provence in France, and which has also
very considerably retreated from the mouth of
the Rhone since the year 1665. In Italy a
considerable tract of land has been gained at
the mouth of the Arno; and Ravenna, formerly
a sea-port, is no longer a maritime town.
Holland appears to be an entire new country,
where the surface of the earth is almost on a
level with the sea, although the land is considerably
elevated by the daily deposit of mud
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
and earth from the Rhine, Maese, &amp;c. for it
was formerly computed that the ground of
Holland was, in many places, 50 feet lower
than the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>It is asserted, that in the year 860, a furious
tempest drove on the coast so great a quantity
of sand that it shut up the mouth of the Rhine,
near the Cat, and that this river inundated the
whole country, tore up trees and houses, and,
at last, emptied itself into the channel of the
Maese. In 1421 another inundation separated
the town of Dordrecht from the main land,
submerged 72 villages, many castles, and
drowned 100,000 souls, beside a great number
of cattle. The dyke of Yssel was broken
in 1638 by the ice brought down by the
Rhine, which, having shut up the passage of
the water, made an opening of some fathoms,
and a great part of the province was overflowed
before the breach could be repaired.
In 1682 there was a similar inundation in the
province of Zealand, which destroyed upwards
of 30 villages, and drowned a considerable
number of people and cattle, from their being
surprised by the waters in the night. It was
a fortunate circumstance for Holland that a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
south wind opposed the inroad of the sea, for
it was so greatly swelled that the water was 18
feet higher than the highest ground of the province.<a name="FNanchor_AT_46" id="FNanchor_AT_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_AT_46" class="fnanchor">[AT]</a></p>

<p>At Hithe, in the county of Kent, the harbour
has filled up in defiance of every expence
and precaution that was made to prevent it.
A surprising number of sea-shells, &amp;c. are met
with for several miles round, which were formerly
heaped together, and which are now
covered by earth, and are beautiful meadows.
On the other side the sea has gained in several
places, as for instance, the Goodwin Sands,
which was an estate belonging to an Earl of
that name, but at present is no more than
sand covered by the waters of the sea: thus
the sea in many places gains on the land and
loses in others, according to the different situation
of the coasts, and other circumstances.<a name="FNanchor_AU_47" id="FNanchor_AU_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_AU_47" class="fnanchor">[AU]</a></p>

<p>It is not in Europe alone we meet with these
vicissitudes of land into sea and sea into land;
other parts of the world might furnish more
remarkable, and in a greater number, if investigated
with precision.</p>

<p>Calecut was formerly a famous city and the
capital of a kingdom of that name; at present
it is only a trifling town, meanly built, and but
thinly inhabited: the sea, which for a century
has gained greatly on this coast, has overflowed
the greatest part of the old city, with a beautiful
fortress of stone which was therein. Vessels
at present moor on their ruins, and the port is
filled with a great number of shoals, and on
which ships are frequently wrecked.<a name="FNanchor_AW_49" id="FNanchor_AW_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_AW_49" class="fnanchor">[AW]</a></p>

<p>The province of Jucatan, a peninsula in the
gulph of Mexico, was formerly a part of the
sea. This neck of ground extends 100 leagues
in length, and is not more than 25 leagues at
its greatest breadth. The air is perfectly hot
and moist. Although there are neither rivulets
nor rivers throughout so long a space, the water
is every where so nigh the surface as to furnish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
plenty; and, by opening the earth, so great a
number of shells are found as to leave no doubt
that this great extent may be regarded as a place
which formerly was part of the sea.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Malabar pretend that
formerly the Maldivian islands were attached
to the Indian continent, and that the violence
of the sea has divided them from it. The
number of these islands is so great, and some of
the channels, which separate them, are so narrow,
that the boltsprits of vessels which pass
them tear off the leaves of the trees on each
side, and in some places an active man, by
holding by the branch of a tree, may leap into
another island.<a name="FNanchor_AX_50" id="FNanchor_AX_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_AX_50" class="fnanchor">[AX]</a></p>

<p>The cocoa-trees, which are at the bottom of
the sea, is a proof that the Maldivians were
formerly part of the continent: cocoa-nuts are
often detached from them and thrown on the
shore by a storm.</p>

<p>It is imagined that the island of Ceylon was
formerly united to the continent, and that the
currents, which are extremely rapid in many
parts of India, have divided that as well as
Rammanakoil, and many other islands.<a name="FNanchor_AY_51" id="FNanchor_AY_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_AY_51" class="fnanchor">[AY]</a> However,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
it is certain that the island of Ceylon
has lost 30 or 40 leagues of ground towards
the north-west side, which the sea has gained.</p>

<p>It appears that the sea has recently forsaken
a great part of the projecting lands and islands
of America. We have just observed, that the
ground of Jucatan is filled with shells. It is
the same with the low lands of Martinico and
the other Antille islands. The inhabitants
have termed the earth below the surface lime,
because they make their lime with these shells,
considerable banks of which are found immediately
under the vegetable earth. In the new
voyages to the islands of America it is said,
"lime, which is found in the land of Guadaloupe,
when the earth is turned up, is of the
same kind as that drawn out of the sea, the
reason of which is difficult to be assigned.
Might it not be possible, that all the extent of
ground, which composes this island, was, in
former times, only a high ground filled with
lime-plants, which having grown and filled the
void spaces that were occupied by the water,
have raised up the ground, obliged the water
to retire, and leave all the superficies dry?
This conjecture, as extraordinary as at first it
may appear, has, nevertheless, nothing impossible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
in it; and if the people who reside
there were to dig in different parts of the
earth they would discover what the real soil is,
and by that means destroy or strengthen my
conjecture."</p>

<p>There are some lands which are sometimes
covered with water and sometimes uncovered,
as many islands in Norway, Scotland, Maldivias,
the gulph of Cambaya, &amp;c. The
Baltic has, by little and little, gained a great
part of Pomerania, and covered and destroyed
the famous port of Vineta. So likewise the
sea of Norway has projected into the continent,
and formed many small islands. The
German sea has projected into Holland near
Cat, insomuch that the ruins of an ancient
citadel of the Romans, which was formerly
on the coast, are now very far in the sea.
The marshy grounds in the Isle of Ely, in
England, and those in Provence, in France,
are, on the contrary, as we have observed,
land which the sea has abandoned. Downs
have been formed by the sea-winds, which
have thrown and accumulated earth, sand,
shells, &amp;c. on the shore. For example, on the
western coast of France, Spain, and Africa,
durable and violent westerly winds reign,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
which impel the waters towards the shore with
great impetuosity, and on which coasts downs
are very frequent. In the like manner the
easterly winds, when they remain any long
time, so strongly drive the waters from the
coasts of Syria and Ph&#339;nicia that the chain of
rocks, which are covered with water during
the westerly winds, are left quite dry. Thus
downs are never composed of stone, or marble,
like mountains formed in the bottom of the
sea, because they have not been long enough
under the water. In our discourse on minerals
we shall shew that the sea possesses the power
of petrifaction, and that the stones formed in
the earth are quite different from those formed
in the sea.</p>

<p>When I had just finished my Theory of the
Earth, which I composed in 1744, I received
from Mons. Barrere, his dissertation on the
origin of figured stones, and I was pleased to
find myself of the same opinion with this able
naturalist, on the subject of the formation of
downs, and the time the water remained
on the earth which we inhabit; he recounts
many alterations which have happened to the
sea coasts: "<i>Aiguis-mortes</i>, which is now more
than a league and a half from the sea, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
a port in the time of St. Louis: Psalmodi was
an island in 815, and at present it is inland two
leagues from the sea. It is the same with
respect to Maguelone. The greatest part of
the vineyards of Agde, was forty years ago
covered by the sea: and in Spain the sea has
considerably retreated within a short space of
time from Blancs, Badalona, the mouth of the
river Vobregat, Cape Tortosa, along the coasts
of Valentia, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"The sea may form hills and mountains in
many different manners; first, by the transportations
of earth, sand, and shells, from one
place to another; secondly, by depositing sediments,
consisting of small particles detached
from the coasts and bottom, and which it
might have transported from a considerable
distance; and lastly, by sand, mud, and other
articles, which the sea winds often drive
against coasts, downs and hills may be produced,
which the water forsaking, by degrees,
become parts of the continent." The downs
of Flanders and Holland are of this kind,
being only hills composed of sand and shells,
which the sea winds have driven towards the
land. Mons. Barrere quotes another example
which merits a place in this work. "The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
sea, by its motion, detaches from its bottom an
infinity of plants, shells, slime, and sand,
which the waves and winds continually drive
towards the shore. Now, all these different
operations must continually form new strata,
elevate the beds of earth, gradually raising
downs and hills, retrenching the bounds of
the ocean, and by that means extending the
lands on the continents."</p>

<p>"It is visible that new strata have been successively
formed by the same reiterated motion of the
waters from the deposition of sediments and other
constant causes from time immemorial; of
which I find strong proofs in the different
beds of fossils, shells, and other marine productions
found in Roussillon near the village
of Naffiac, about seven or eight leagues from
the sea; these beds of shells which are inclined
from the west to the east, and in different
angles, are separated from each other by banks
of sand and earth, are sometimes from one and
a half to two or three feet in thickness. They
appear as if sprinkled with salt in dry weather,
and form together hillocks from twenty-five to
thirty fathoms in height: now a long chain
of hills of such an height can only be formed
gradually, and at different successions of time.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
Such might be the effect of an universal deluge,
which must have disturbed all nature; but
which could not have given a regular form
to these different beds of fossil shells, but
would have jumbled them together without any
order or regularity."</p>

<p>On this subject I am perfectly of the same
opinion as M. Barrere, excepting as to the
formation of mountains, which I cannot agree
ought to be entirely attributed to the causes
which occasion the ocean to gain upon the
land on some parts, and lose it upon others.
As I am, on the contrary, of opinion, I could
produce many convincing arguments to prove
that most of the eminencies seen on the surface
of the earth have been actually formed in the
sea itself. First, because they have a correspondence
of saillant and returning angles,
which necessarily implies the cause we have
assigned, that is, the motion of the currents.
Secondly, because downs and hills, which are
formed by the materials that the sea brings on
its shores, are not composed of marble and
hard stone, like common hills; the shells also
in the former are generally only fossils, whereas
in the latter, the petrifaction is compleat; besides
the beds of earth are not so horizontal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
in downs as in the hills composed of marble and
hard stone, but are more or less inclined, as in
the hills of Naffiac, whereas in the hills and
mountains, formed under the water by the
sediment of the sea, the strata are always
parallel, and very often horizontal, and the
shells and other marble are entirely petrified.
I have no doubt of proving that marble and
other calcinable matters, which are almost all
composed of madrepores, astroites, and shells,
have acquired their hardness and perfection
at the bottom of the sea; on the contrary,
gravel, soft stones, incrustations, stalactites,
&amp;c. which are also calcinable and found in the
earth, and formed since our continent has been
discovered, cannot acquire this degree of hardness
and petrifaction which marble or hard
stones have.</p>

<p>In the history of the French Academy for
1708, may be seen the observations of Saulmon,
on the subject of the galets found in many
places. These galets are round and flat flints
very smooth, and which are cast on the shores
by the sea. At Bayeux, and at Prutel, which are
a league from the sea, we find them in digging
wells or pits. The mountains of Bonneuil,
Broie, and Quesny, which are eighteen leagues
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
from the sea, are all covered with galets; they
are also found in the valley of Clermont in
Beauvois. M. Saulmon likewise relates, that
a hole, 16 feet deep, was bored horizontally
into the beach of Tresport, which is soft earth,
and that it entirely disappeared in 30 years:
so that if the sea always encroaches alike, it
would gain half a league in 12,000 years.</p>

<p>The motions of the sea are therefore the
principal causes of the alterations which have
happened, and which daily happen on the
surface of the globe. But there are many,
other causes, which, though less considerable,
contribute to those changes. Running waters,
rivers, streams, the melting of snow, torrents,
frosts, &amp;c. have occasioned many changes;
the rains have diminished the height of mountains;
rivers and rivulets have raised plains, and
stopped up the sea at their mouths; the melting
of snow, and torrents, have dug hollows in
vallies; and the frosts have split rocks and separated
them from their former stations. We
might quote an infinity of examples on the
alterations these causes have occasioned. Varenius
says, that rivers convey into the sea
great quantities of earth, which they deposit at
a greater or less distance from the coasts, according
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
to the rapidity of their currents; these
earths fall to the bottom of the sea, and, at
first, form those small banks which daily encrease,
become shoals, and, at last, form islands,
which are fertile and inhabitable. This is the
manner in which the islands of the Nile are
formed, as well as those of St. Laurence, the
Isle of Landa, situate on the coast of Africa,
near the mouth of the river Coanza, the island
of Norway, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_AZ_52" id="FNanchor_AZ_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_AZ_52" class="fnanchor">[AZ]</a> To these may be added the
island of Trong Ming, at China, which has
been gradually formed by the earth that the
river Nankin has brought and deposited it at its
mouth. This island is more than 20 leagues
long by five or six broad.<a name="FNanchor_BA_53" id="FNanchor_BA_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_BA_53" class="fnanchor">[BA]</a></p>

<p>The Po, Trento, Athesis, and other rivers
of Italy, bring with them great quantities of
earths into the lakes of Venice, especially
during the time of inundations, which, in
course of time, must fill them up. In many
places they are now dry at low water, and, excepting
the canals, which are kept up at a great
expence, have no depth of water.</p>

<p>At the mouths of the Nile, the Ganges, the
Indus, the Plata, the Nankin, and of many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
other rivers, the earth and sand deposited form
considerable banks. Loubere, in his Voyage
to Siam, says, that the banks of sand and earth
daily increase at the mouths of the great rivers
of Asia, insomuch that the navigation of them
becomes every day more difficult, and will one
day be impassable. The same remark may be
made of the large rivers of Europe, and particularly

70 mouths in the Caspian sea, and of the Danube,
which has seven in the Black sea, &amp;c.</p>

<p>As it seldom rains in Egypt the regular
inundations of the Nile proceed from the
torrents which fall therein from Ethiopa. These
annually bring with them great quantities of
mud, which they not only deposit on the land
of Egypt but even throw to a considerable
distance in the sea, and thus lay the foundation
of a new land, which, in the course of
time, arises therefrom; for, by sounding with
the lead, we find, at more than 20 leagues
distance from the coast, the mud of the Nile
at the bottom of the sea, and which is every
year increasing. Lower Egypt, where<a name="FNanchor_BB_54" id="FNanchor_BB_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_BB_54" class="fnanchor">[BB]</a> Dela
at present stands, was formerly a gulph of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
sea. Homer tells us that the island of Pharos
was 24 hours voyage from Egypt, and at present
it is almost contiguous to it. The soil of
Egypt has not the same depth of good ground
throughout its extent, it lessens as we approach
the sea. Near the borders of the Nile there
is sometimes near thirty feet depth of good earth,
whereas at the extremity of the inundation
there is scarcely more than seven inches.<a name="FNanchor_BC_55" id="FNanchor_BC_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_BC_55" class="fnanchor">[BC]</a>
The town of Damietta, at present more than
10 miles from the sea, in 1243 was a sea-port.
The town of Fooah, which, 300 years ago,
was situate at the mouth of the Canopic, a
branch of the Nile, is now more than seven
leagues from it. Within 40 years the sea has
retreated half a league from before Rosetta and
Idern.</p>

<p>The great rivers of America, and even
those which have been but lately discovered,
have suffered great alterations at their mouths.
Charlevoix, speaking of the river Mississipi,
says, that at its mouth, below New Orleans,
the country forms a point of land which does
not appear to be very ancient, for by digging
but a little into the earth water is met with;
besides, the quantity of small islands which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
have recently been formed at all the mouths of
this river, leaves no doubt of this neck of
land being formed after the same manner. It
appears certain, says he, that when M. de la
Salle went down the Mississipi, to the sea, the
mouth of this river was not as it is at this
present time.</p>

<p>"The nearer we approach towards the sea,
adds he, the more it becomes perceptible, the
bar has scarcely any water in most of the
small outlets which the river has opened, and
which have multiplied so greatly from the
trees that are carried along with the currents,
one of which stopt in a part where it is
shallow, will entangle hundreds. I have seen,
continues he, 200 leagues from New Orleans,
collections of trees, one of which would have
filled all the timber-yards of Paris. Nothing
can set them free; the mud which the river
brings down serves to cement, and, by degrees,
covers them. Each inundation leaves a new stratum,
and, after 10 years, shrubs and vegetables
grow thereon: after this manner most points
and islands are formed, which so often change
the course of rivers."<a name="FNanchor_BD_56" id="FNanchor_BD_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_BD_56" class="fnanchor">[BD]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless all the changes which rivers
cause are very slow, and become not considerable
till after a long series of years: but quick
and sudden changes have happened by inundations
and earthquakes. The ancient
Egyptian priests, 600 years before the birth
of Christ, asserted, according to the Timæus
of Plato, that there was a great island near
Hercules Pillars; called <i>Atlantis</i>, which was
larger than Lybia and Asia taken together;
and that this island was buried under the waters
of the ocean after a great earthquake. "Traditur
Atheniensis civitas restitisse olim innumeris
hostium copiis quæ, ex Atlantico mari
profectæ, prope cunctam Europam Asiamque
obsederunt; tunc enim fretum illud navigabile
habens in ore et quasi vestibulo ejus insulam
quam Herculis columnas cognominant; ferturque
insula illa Lybiâ simul et Asiâ Major
fuisse, per quam ad alias proximas insulas
patebat aditus, atque ex insulis ad omnem
continentem è conspectu jacentem vero mari
vicinam: sed intrà os ipsum portes augusto
sinu traditur, pelagus illud verum mare, terra
quoque illa verè erat continens, &amp;c. Post
hæc ingenti terræ motu jugique diei unius et
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
noctis illuvione factum est, ut terra dehiscens
omnis illos bellicosos absorberet, et Atlantis
insula sub vasto gurgite mergeretur." <i>Plato in
Timæus.</i> This ancient tradition is not absolutely
contrary to all probability. The earths
which were absorbed by the waters are perhaps
those which join Ireland to the Azores,
and those to the continent of America; for
in Ireland there are the same fossils, shells,
and marine productions as in America, some
of which are different from any found in other
parts of Europe,</p>

<p>Eusebius relates two testimonies on the subject
of deluges: one of which is Melo, who
says that the plains of Syria had formerly been
laid under water; the other is Abydenus, who
says, that in the time of King Sisithrus there
was a great deluge, which had been predicted
by Saturnus, Plutarch <i>De Solestia Animalium</i>.
Ovid, and other mythologists, speak of the
deluge of Deucalion, which, according to them,
was in Thessaly, about 700 years from the
universal deluge. It is also asserted that there
had been one more ancient in Attica, in the
time of Ogiges, about 230 years before that of
Deucalion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>In the year 1095 there was a deluge in
Syria, which drowned a number of people.<a name="FNanchor_BE_57" id="FNanchor_BE_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_BE_57" class="fnanchor">[BE]</a>
In 1164 there was so considerable a one in
Friezeland, that all maritime coasts were
covered, and several thousands of the inhabitants
drowned.<a name="FNanchor_BF_58" id="FNanchor_BF_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_BF_58" class="fnanchor">[BF]</a> In 1218 there was another
inundation which destroyed near an hundred
thousand people. There are a multitude of
other examples of great inundations, like that of
1604 in England, and many more.</p>

<p>A third cause of the change on the surface
of the globe, are impetuous winds. They not
only form downs and hills on the sea shores, but
they often stop and choak up rivers, and change
their directions; they tear up cultivated land,
destroy trees, overthrow edifices, and cover
entire countries with sand. We have an example
of these inundations of sand on the
coasts of Britany in France: the history of
the Royal Academy at Paris, anno 1722, makes
mention of it in the following terms.</p>

<p>"In the environs of St. Paul de Leon, in
Lower Britany, there is a quarter near the sea,
which before the year 1666, was inhabited;
but is so no longer, by reason of a sand which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
covers it to the height of more than twenty
feet, and which gains ground every year.
Reckoning from that time it has proceeded
upwards of six leagues into the country, and
is now not more than about half a league
from St. Paul, so that according to all appearance
that town must soon be deserted. The
tops of some steeples and chimnies are still
seen peeping out of this sea of sand; the inhabitants
of the interred villages have always
had sufficient time to quit their houses in
safety.</p>

<p>"An east or north wind increases this calamity,
by raising up a sand of a very fine
nature, which sweeps it away in such great
quantities, and with such velocity, that M.
Deslandes, to whom the academy are indebted
for this observation, when walking in that
country during an east wind, was obliged, from
time to time, to wipe it off his hat and cloaths
they were so loaded with sand, and felt so
heavy. Besides, when this wind is violent, it
throws this sand over a small arm of the sea
into Roscof, a small port much frequented by
foreign vessels; the sand collects in their streets
to the height of two feet, and the inhabitants
are obliged to have it carted away. There are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
many ferruginous particles in this sand, which
are easily discovered by a magnet.</p>

<p>"The coast which furnishes this sand extends
from St. Paul as far as Plouefoat, somewhat
more than four leagues. The disposition of
the place is such that only the east or the north-east
wind can convey the sand over the lands.
It is easy to be conceived how the sand, conveyed
and accumulated by the wind in one
part, can again be taken up by the same wind
and carried farther, and that the sand can thus
advance into and cover the country while the
mine which furnishes it continues unexhausted;
for without this the sand, by advancing,
would always diminish in height, and would
cease its destructive ravages. Now it is but
too possible that the sea throws up or deposits
new sand in the place from whence the wind
raises it up, and therefore the dreadful effects
may long continue.</p>

<p>"The disaster is but of modern date,
possibly the shoal which furnishes it has not
yet a sufficient quantity to lift itself above the
surface of the sea, or perhaps the sea has but
just left it uncovered. There has been some
alteration on the coast, and the sea at present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
reaches, at high water, half a league beyond
certain rocks that formerly it never passed.</p>

<p>"This unhappy province justifies what the
ancient and modern travellers relate concerning
the tempests of sand in the deserts of Arabia, in
which cities and armies have been enveloped
and destroyed."</p>

<p>Mr. Shaw tells us that the ports of Laodicea,
Jebila, Tortosa, Rowada, Tripoli, Tyre, Acra,
and Jaffa, are all filled up with sand brought
thither by the great waves which beat on that
side of the Mediterranean when the west wind
blows impetuously.<a name="FNanchor_BG_59" id="FNanchor_BG_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_BG_59" class="fnanchor">[BG]</a></p>

<p>It is useless to give a greater number of examples
of the alterations that have happened
on the surface of the globe. Fire, air, and
water, produce continual changes, which become
very considerable by time. It is not
from general causes alone, whose effects are
periodical and regular, that the sea successively
takes the place of the earth, and forsakes its
own dominions. There are a number of particular
causes which contribute to these mutations,
such as earthquakes, inundations, sinking
of mountains, &amp;c. Thus the most solid thing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
at least to our conception, like the rest of nature,
undergoes continual and perpetual vicissitudes.</p>

whole of the present dry land was formerly covered
by the sea. It appears also as certain,
from Article <a href="#ARTICLE_XII"><span class="smcap">XII.</span></a> that the flux and reflux, and
other motions of the ocean, continually detach,
from the side and the bottom of the sea, shells
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
and matters of every kind, some part of which
are deposited in other places in form of sediments,
and which are the origin of the parallel
and horizontal strata every where to be met
with. We have proved in Article <a href="#ARTICLE_XIX"><span class="smcap">IX.</span></a> that the
inequalities of the globe have been caused by
the motion of the sea, and that mountains have
been produced by the successive masses and
heapings of the sediments we have just described.
It is evident by Article <a href="#ARTICLE_XIII"><span class="smcap">XIII.</span></a> that the
currents, which at first followed the direction
of these inequalities, afterwards gave to them
all the figure which they at present preserve;
that is, that alternate correspondence of the
saliant angles always opposed to the returning
angles. It appears likewise by Articles <a href="#ARTICLE_XVIII"><span class="smcap">VIII.</span></a>
and <a href="#ARTICLE_XVIII"><span class="smcap">XVIII.</span></a> that the greatest part of the matters
which the sea has detached from its sides and
bottom were, when deposited as sediments, in
form of a fine impalpable powder, which perfectly
filled the cavities of the shells, whether
it was of the same nature or only analogous to
that with which they were composed. It is
certain, from Article <a href="#ARTICLE_XVII"><span class="smcap">XVII.</span></a> that the horizontal
strata which have been produced by the accumulation
of sediments, and which at first were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
in a soft state, acquired hardness in proportion
as they became dry, and that this drying has
produced perpendicular clefts, which cross the
horizontal strata.</p>

<p>It is impossible to doubt, after perusing the
facts in the Articles <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/44792/44792-h/44792-h.htm#ARTICLE_X"><span class="smcap">X.</span></a> <a href="#ARTICLE_XI"><span class="smcap">XI.</span></a>

that an infinite number of
revolutions, particular changes and alterations,
have happened on the surface of the globe, as
well from the natural motion of the waters of
the sea as by the effects of rain, frost, running
waters, winds, subterraneous fires, earthquakes,
inundations, &amp;c. and that consequently the sea
has alternately changed places with the earth,
especially in the earliest times after the creation,
when the terrestrial matters were much softer
than they are at present. It must nevertheless
be acknowledged, that we can but very, imperfectly
judge of the succession of natural
revolutions; that we can still less judge of the
cause of accidents, changes, and alterations;
that the defect of historical monuments deprives
us of the knowledge of particular facts,
and experience and time is deficient to us.
We do not pay any consideration that, though
the time of our existence is very limited, nature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
proceeds in her regular course. We would
condense into our momentary existence the
transactions of ages past and to come, without
reflecting that this instant of time, nay even
human life itself, is only a single fact in the
history of the acts of the Almighty.</p>

<p class="caption3">A COMPARISON BETWEEN ANIMALS, VEGETABLES,
AND OTHER PRODUCTIONS OF NATURE.</p>


<p>Amidst the infinite number of objects
that offer themselves to our view, and with
which the surface of the earth is every where
covered, Animals hold the first rank both on
account of their formation, and their evident
superiority over vegetables and other matters.
Animals, by their senses, form, motion, and
many other properties, have a more intimate
connection with those things which surround
them than vegetables; and the latter, by
their figure, growth, and variety of component
parts, have also a nearer relation with external
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
objects, than either minerals or stones, which
have not any kind of life or motion. By this
number of properties it is, that the animal
claims pre-eminence over the vegetable, and
the vegetable over the mineral. Man, to consider
him by his material form alone, is only
superior to the brute creation by possessing
some few peculiar properties, such as those
given to him by his tongue and hands; and although
the works of the Creator are in themselves
equally perfect, the animal, according
to our mode of perception, is the most complete,
and man the most perfect animal.</p>

<p>What variety of springs, what forces, and
what mechanical motions are enclosed in this
small part of matter which composes the body
of an animal? What properties, what harmony,
and what correspondence between the
various parts? How many combinations, arrangements,
causes, effects, and principles,
conspire to complete one end, and which we
know only to be results so very difficult to
comprehend, that they only cease from being
marvellous by the long custom of not reflecting
on them?</p>

<p>Nevertheless, however admirable this work
appears, it is not the individual that is the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
wonderful; but it is in the succession, reproduction,
and duration of species, that nature
becomes inconceivable. This faculty of reproduction,
which resides alone in animals and
vegetables; this kind of unity always subsisting,
and seemingly eternal; this procreative power,
which perpetually exercises itself without being
destroyed, is a mystery, the depth of which we
are not enabled to fathom.</p>

<p>Inanimate bodies, even the stones and dirt
under our feet, have some properties; their existence
alone supposes a great number; and the
least organic matter has an infinity of relations
with the other parts of the universe. We shall
not say, with some philosophers, that matter,
under whatever form it may be, is sensible of
its existence and relative faculties. This is a
metaphysical question, and of which we do not
here propose to treat, it will be sufficient to observe,
that not having a perfect knowledge of
our own relation with external objects, we cannot
doubt that inanimate matters are still more
ignorant; besides, as our sensations do not in the
least resemble the objects which cause them,
we must conclude, by analogy, that inanimate
matter has neither sentiment, sensation, nor a
consciousness of its existence; to attribute any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
of these faculties to it, would be giving it the
power of thought, action, and perception, nearly
in the same manner as we think, act, and feel,
which is as much repugnant to reason as it is to
religion.</p>

<p>Inanimate bodies being formed of earth and
dust, we have, of course, some properties in
common with them, but they are merely relative
to what arises from general matter, such as
extent, impenetrability, weight, &amp;c. but as these
properties, purely material, make no impression
of themselves, as they exist entirely independent,
and do not at all affect us, we cannot
consider them as a part of our being; it is therefore
the organization, the soul, and the life,
which constitute our existence. Matter, considered
in this light, is less the principal than
the accessor. It is a foreign expansion, the
union of which is unknown, and the presence
hurtful to us; and thought, which is the constituent
principle of our being, is very probably
entirely independent.</p>

<p>We exist, therefore, without knowing how,
and we think without knowing why; but
whatever is the manner of our being or thinking,
whether our sensations are true or false,
the result of them are not less certain. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
order of ideas, this train of thoughts, which
internally exist from ourselves, although very
different from the objects that cause them,
give rise to the most real affections, and occasion
relations with external objects, which we
may consider as real affinities, since they are
invariable, and always the same. The human
species, therefore, may be said to hold the first
rank in the order of nature, the brute creation
the second, vegetables the third, and minerals
the last; for although we cannot clearly distinguish
between our animal and spiritual qualities,
and although the brute creation are endowed
with the same senses, possess the same
principles of life and motion, and perform a
number of actions like man, yet they have not
the relation with external objects in the same
extensive manner we have, and consequently
the resemblance must fail in various respects.
The distance is greater between man and vegetables,
and still more so from minerals, as
vegetables possess a degree of animation, while
minerals are destitute of every principle that
tends to organization.</p>

<p>To compose, therefore, the history of an
animal, we must first nicely inspect into the
general order of his particular relations, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
afterwards distinguish those he has in common
with vegetables and minerals. An animal has
nothing in common with a mineral, excepting
general properties of matter; his nature and
&#339;conomy are totally different: the mineral is
a mere senseless and inactive matter, without
organization, faculties, or power of reproduction;
a dead mass, fit only to be trod under
foot by man and animals; even the most precious
metals are thus considered by the philosopher,
as they possess but an arbitrary value,
subordinate to the will, and dependent on the
convention of men.</p>

<p>In an animal all the powers of nature are
united; the properties by which it is animated are
peculiar to it; by its senses it can will, act, determine,
and communicate with the most distant
objects: its body is a centre, to which every
thing is connected; a point where the whole
universe is reflected; a world in miniature.
These are the properties which peculiarly belong
to it; those which it possesses in common
with vegetables are the faculties of growth, expansion,
reproduction, and increase.</p>

<p>The most apparent difference between animals
and vegetables seems to be the faculty of
moving from place to place, which animals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
are endowed with and vegetables not. It is
true we are not acquainted with any vegetable
that has a single progressive motion; and there
are many kinds of animals, as oysters, &amp;c. to
which this motion seems to have been denied;
the distinction, therefore, is neither general
nor necessary.</p>

<p>A more essential difference might be drawn
from the faculty of sensation; but sensation includes
such a variety of ideas, that we ought
not to mention the word without giving some
explication; for if by sensation we understand
only a motion, occasioned by a check or resistance,
we shall find the <i>sensitive</i>-plant is also
possessed of it; if, on the contrary, we would
have it signify to apprehend and compare ideas,
we are not certain that brute animals possess
it; if it is allowed to dogs, elephants, &amp;c.
whose actions seem to result from the same
causes as those of men, it must be denied to an
infinite number of others, especially to those
which seem to be motionless. If we could
give to oysters, for example, the same faculty
of sensation as to dogs, though in an inferior
degree, why should we not allow it to vegetables
in a still lesser degree? This difference
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
between animals and vegetables is not, therefore,
general, nor well decided.</p>

<p>A third difference seems to arise from their
method of feeding. Animals, by the means
of certain external organs, seize those things
which are agreeable to them: they seek their
pasture and chuse their food. Plants are reduced
to the necessity of receiving such nutriment
as the earth furnishes: they have no diversity
in the manner of procuring it; no choice
in the kind, but the humidity of the earth is
their only aliment; nevertheless, if we attend
to the organization and action of roots and
leaves, we shall presently discover that there
are in those parts external organs, which vegetables
make use of to obtain their food; that the
root avoids and turns from an obstacle, or vein
of bad earth, to seek for one that is better; that
they divide their fibres, and even go so far as to
change their form to procure nutriment for the
plant. The difference between animals and
vegetables cannot, therefore, be established on
the manner in which they receive their nutriment.</p>

<p>This investigation induces us to conclude
that there is no absolute essential and general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
difference between animals and vegetables, but
that nature descends, by degrees imperceptibly
from an animal which is the most perfect, to
that which is the least, and from the latter to
the vegetable. The water polypus may therefore
be considered as the line where the animal
creation ends and that of plants begin.</p>

<p>If, after having examined the distinctions,
we search after the resemblances between animals
and vegetables, we shall find the power of
reproduction is general, and very essential to
both; a faculty which would almost lead us to
suppose that animals and vegetables are nearly
of the same order of beings.</p>

<p>A second resemblance may be drawn from
the expansion of their parts, a property which
is common to both; for vegetables grow as
well as animals, and if the manner in which
they expand is different, it is not totally nor
essentially so, since there are very considerable
parts in animals, as the bones, the hair, the
nails, the horns, &amp;c. whose expansion is a perfect
and real vegetation; and the f&#339;tus, at its
first formation, may be said rather to vegetate
than live.</p>

<p>A third resemblance arises from there being
some animals which propagate like plants, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
by the same method. The multiplication of
the vine-fretter, which is made without copulation,
is like that of plants by seeds; and that
of polypuses, by cutting them, resembles the
multiplication of trees by slips.</p>

<p>We can then assert with greater foundation,
that animals and vegetables are beings of the
same order, and that nature passes from one to
the other by insensible links; since the properties
wherein they resemble each other are general
and essential, and those on which they
differ confined and particular.</p>

<p>If we compare animals and vegetables by
other lights, for example, by number, situation,
size, form, &amp;c. we shall draw fresh inductions
from them.</p>

<p>The number of the animal species is much
greater than that of plants. In the class of insects
alone there are a greater number of species
than there are kinds of plants on the surface of
the earth. Animals likewise much less resemble
each other than plants; and it is this resemblance
among the latter which makes the difficulty
of knowing and discerning them, and has
given rise to so many botanical systems; and it
is for this reason that more labour has been
bestowed on that than on zoology.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides, there is another advantage of knowing
the species of animals, and distinguishing
them one from another, which is by regarding
those as one and the same species, who, by means
of copulation, produce and perpetuate beings
like themselves; and as a different species, those
from a connection between whom nothing is
produced, or whose product are unlike their
parents. Thus a fox will be a different species
from a dog, if nothing results from a
copulation of a male and female of these two
animals, and when even there should result a
bipartite animal, or a kind of mule, which
cannot generate, that will be sufficient to
establish the fox and dog of two different species.
There is not the same advantage to be
had in plants, for although some have pretended
to discover sexes, and although divisions
of breeds have been established by the parts
of fecundation; yet, as these distinctions
neither are so certain, nor so apparent as
in animals, and the production of plants is
made in many modes, that the sex has no part
in, and where the parts of fecundation are
not necessary, this idea cannot be made use
of with any success; it is only on a misapprehended
analogy that this sexual method has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
been pretended to distinguish all the different
species of plants.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the number of animals is
greater than that of plants, yet that is not the
case with respect to the number of individuals
in each species. In animals as well as in
plants, the number of individuals is much
greater in the small species than in the large.
Flies are, perhaps, a million times more numerous
than elephants; so likewise there are
more kinds of plants than trees; but, if we
compare the quantity of individuals in each
species, we shall find that the plant is more
abundant than the animal; for example, quadrupeds
bring forth but a small number of
young, and at considerable distances of time;
trees, on the contrary, produce every year, a
great quantity. It may be said that this comparison
is not exact, and to render it so, we
should compare the quantity of seeds produced
by a tree, with a quantity of germs contained
in the semen of an animal, and then, perhaps,
we should find, that animals are still more
abundant in their seed than vegetables. But
it should be considered that it is possible by
collecting and sowing all the seeds of an elm,
for instance, that we might have 100,000 young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
ones from the product of a single year; and
that should we supply a horse with as many
mares as he could cover in one year, there
would be a great difference between the production
of the animal and that of the vegetable.
I shall not examine into the quantity
of germs; first, because we are not acquainted
with it in the animal creation: and secondly,
because possibly there is the same number of
seminal shoots in the vegetable: for the seed of
a vegetable is not a germ, being as perfect a
production as the f&#339;tus of an animal, and to
which, like that, a greater expansion is only
wanting.</p>

<p>To my comparison may likewise be opposed
the prodigious multiplication of certain kinds
of insects: as the bee in particular, one of
which will produce thirty or forty thousand.
But it must be observed, that I speak in general
of animals compared with vegetables; and
besides, this example of bees, which perhaps
is the greatest multiplication among animals,
does not constitute a proof against what we have
observed; for of thirty or forty thousand flies
produced by the female bee, there is but few
females; fifteen hundred, or two thousand
males, and all the rest moles, or rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
neutral flies, without sex, and incapable of
procreating.</p>

<p>It must be owned, that in insects, fish, and
shell-fish, there are species which seem to be
very abundant; oysters, herrings, fleas, beetles,
&amp;c. are perhaps in as great numbers as
mosses and the most common plants; but on
the whole, the greatest number of the animal
species is less abundant than the vegetable; and
by comparing different kinds of plants with
each other, there is not found such great differences
in the number, as in the animal species;
some of which bring forth a prodigious
number, and others only a few; whereas the
number of productions in plants is always very
great throughout.</p>

<p>By what we have observed, it appears that
the smallest and basest species seem to be the
most prolific: the most minute are the most
plentiful as well in animals as in plants, and in
proportion as the animals are more perfect, they
appear to decrease in number of individuals.
Can it be thought, that certain forms of the
body, as those of quadrupeds and birds, requisite
for the perfection of sensation, would cost
nature more organic particles than the production
of less important animals?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us now pass to the comparison of animals
and vegetables, with respect to situation,
form, and size. The earth is the only place
wherein vegetables can subsist. The greatest
number grow above the surface, and are attached
to the soil by roots. Some, as truffles,
are entirely covered with earth, and a few
grow under the water, but all require the
surface of the earth to exist upon. Animals, on
the contrary, are more generally dispersed;
some dwell on the surface, and others in the
bowels of the earth; some live at the bottom,
and others swim in the waters of the ocean:
some exist in the air, others dwell in the internal
parts of plants, on the bodies of men and
other animals, liquors, and even stones are not
without them.</p>

<p>By the use of the microscope, a great number
of new species of animals have been discovered:
but singular as it may appear, we have
not found more than one or two new species
of plants by the help of this instrument.
The small moss is, perhaps, the only microscopical
plant spoken of; and we might, therefore,
imagine that nature refused to produce
very small plants, while she formed animalcules
with profusion; but we might deceive ourselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
by adopting this opinion without examination,
and our error might arise from plants,
in fact, resembling each other more than animals;
so that this moldiness, which we only
take for a very minute moss, may possibly be
a kind of forest or garden, filled with abundance
of various plants, although we are unable
to mark the difference.</p>

<p>By comparing the size of animals and plants
there will be found a great inequality, for the
distance is much greater between the size of a
whale and one of these microscope animals,
than between the highest oak and the moss we
are now speaking of. Although bulk be only
a relative attribute, it may, nevertheless, be
useful to inspect into the extreme boundaries
nature has allotted to her productions. In
bigness animals and plants seem to have a near
equality; a large whale and a large tree forms
a volume not very different; whereas, among
the small it has been asserted there are animals
so very minute that a million of them united
together, would not equal, in size, the smallest
moss-plant ever seen.</p>

<p>The most general and most sensible difference
between animals and vegetables is that of
figure, for the form of animals, although infinitely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
varied, has not any resemblance to
that of plants; and although the polypus will,
like plants, reproduce by cutting, and may be
regarded as the link between the animal and
vegetable kingdoms, not only by the mode of
their reproduction but also by their external
form, nevertheless the figure of the animal is
so different from the external form of a plant
that it is difficult to be deceived therein. Some
animals form things resembling plants or
flowers, but plants never produce any thing
like an animal; and those admirable insects
which produce and form the coral, would not
have been taken for flowers if coral had not
been regarded as a plant. Thus the errors
wherein we might fall, by comparing plants
with animals, will never have any influence
but on a few objects which compose the link
between both, and the more observations we
shall make the more we shall be convinced
that the Creator has not placed a fixed line between
animals and vegetables; that these two
species of organized beings have many more
common properties than real differences; that
the production of an animal does not require
of nature more, and possibly, less exertion
than that of a vegetable; that in general the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
production of organized beings does not require
exertion, and that, in short, the living animated
nature, instead of composing a metaphysical
degree of beings, is a physical property, common
to all matter.</p>

<p>We shall now make a more minute inspection
into this common property of
animal and vegetable nature; this power of
producing its resemblance; this chain of successive
individuals, which constitutes the real
existence of the species; and without attaching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
ourselves to the generation of man, or to that
of any particular kind of animal, let us inspect
the phenomenas of reproduction in general, let
us collect facts, and enumerate the different methods
nature makes use of to renew organized
beings. The first, and as we think the most
simple method, is, to collect in one body an
infinite number of resembling organic bodies,
and so to compose its substance, that there is
not a part of it which does not contain a germ
of the same species, and which consequently
of itself might become a whole, resembling that
of which it constitutes a part. This preparation
seems to suppose a prodigious waste, and to
carry with it profusion; yet it is a very common
munificence of nature, and which manifests
itself even in the most common and inferior
kinds, such as worms, polypuses, elms, willows,
gooseberry-trees, and many other plants and insects,
each part of which contains a whole, and
by the single effect of expansion alone may become
a plant, or an insect. By considering
organized beings in this point of view, an
individual is a whole, uniformly organized in
all its parts; a compound of an infinity of
resembling figures and similar parts, an assemblage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
of germs, or small individuals of the
same kind, which can expand in the same mode
according to circumstances, and form new
bodies, composed like those from whence they
proceed.</p>

<p>By examining this idea thoroughly, we
shall discover a connection between animals,
vegetables, and minerals, which we could not
expect. Salts, and some other minerals, are
composed of parts resembling each other, and
to all that composes them; a grain of salt is a
cube, composed of an infinity of smaller cubes,
which we may easily perceive by a microscope;
these are also composed of other cubes still
smaller, as may be perceived with a better microscope;
and we cannot doubt, but that the
primitive and constituting particles of this
salt are likewise cubes so exceedingly minute
as to escape our sight, and our imagination.
Animals and plants which can multiply by
all their parts, are organized bodies, of which
the primitive and constituting parts are also
organic and similar, of which we discern
the aggregate quantity, but cannot perceive
the primitive parts only by reason and
analogy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>This leads us to believe that there is an infinity
of organic particles actually existing and
living in nature, the substance of which is the
same with that of organized bodies. As we
have just observed, in a structure of a similar
kind, though of inanimate matter, that it was
composed of an infinity of particles which
have a perfect semblance to the whole body,
and as there must perhaps be millions of small
cubes of accumulated salts to form a sensible
individual grain of sea-salt, so likewise millions
of organic particles, like the whole, are required
to form one out of that multiplicity of
germs contained in an elm, or a polypus; and as
we must separate, bruise, and dissolve a cube of
sea-salt to perceive, by means of crystallization,
the small cubes of which it is composed; we
must likewise separate the parts of an elm or
polypus to discover, by means of vegetation
and expansion, the small elms or polypuses
contained in those parts.</p>

<p>The difficulty of giving way to this idea
arises from a prejudice strongly established,
that there is no method of judging of the
complex, except by the simple, and that, to
conceive the organic constitution of a body
we must reduce it to its simple and unorganized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
parts, and that it is more easy to conceive
how a cube is composed of other cubes
than how one polypus is composed of others;
but if we attentively examine what is meant by
simple and complex, we shall then find that in
this, as in every thing else, the plan of nature is
quite different from the very rough draught of
it formed by our ideas.</p>

<p>Our senses, as is well known, do not furnish
us with exact representations of external objects,
insomuch that if we are desirous of estimating,
judging, comparing, measuring, &amp;c.
we are obliged to have recourse to foreign
assistance, to rules, principles, instruments, &amp;c.
All these helps are the works of human knowledge,
and partake more or less of the abstraction
of our ideas; this abstraction, therefore,
is what is called the simple, and the difficulty of
reducing them to this abstraction, the complex.
Extent, for example, being a general and abstracted
property from nature, is not very
complex; nevertheless, to form a judgment of
it, we have supposed extents without depth,
without breadth, and even points without any
extent at all. All these abstractions have been
invented for the support of our judgment, and
the few definitions made use of in geometry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
have occasioned a variety of prejudices and
false conclusions. All that can be reduced by
these definitions are termed <i>simple</i>, and all that
cannot be readily reduced are called <i>complex</i>;
from hence a triangle, a square, a circle, a
cube, &amp;c. are simple subjects, as well as all
curves, whose geometrical laws we are acquainted
with; but all that we cannot reduce
by these abstracted figures and laws are complex.
We do not consider that these geometrical
figures exist only in our imagination;
that they are not to be found in nature, or, at
least, if they are discoverable there, it is because
she exhibits every possible form, and that
it is more difficult and rare to find simple
figures of an equilateral pyramid, or an exact
cube in nature, than compounded forms of a
plant or an animal. In everything, therefore,
we take the abstract for the simple, and the
real for the complex. In Nature, on the contrary,
the abstract has no existence, every
thing is compounded; we shall never, of
course, penetrate into the intimate structure of
bodies: we cannot, therefore, pronounce on
what is complex in a greater or lesser degree,
excepting by the greater or lesser each subject
has to ourselves and to the rest of the universe;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
from which reason it is we judge that the
animal is more compounded than the vegetable,
and the vegetable more than the mineral. This
notion is just with relation to us, but we know
not, in reality, whether the animal, vegetable,
or mineral, is the most simple or complex; and
we are ignorant whether a globule, or a cube,
is more indebted for an exertion of nature,
than a seed or an organic particle. If we
would form conjectures on this subject, we
might suppose that the most common and numerous
things are the most simple but then
animals would be the most simple, since the
number of their kind far exceeds that of plants
or minerals.</p>

<p>But without taking up more time on this
discussion, it is sufficient to have shewn that the
opinions we commonly have of the simple and
complex are ideas of abstraction, that they
cannot be applied to the compound productions
of nature, and that when we attempt to
reduce every being to elements of a regular
figure, or to prismatic, cubical, or globular
particles, we substitute our own imaginations
in the place of realities; that the forms of the
constituting particles of different bodies are
absolutely unknown to us, and that, consequently,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
we can suppose, that an organized body
is composed of organic particles, as well as
that a cube is composed of other cubes.</p>

<p>We have no other rule to judge by than experience.
We perceive that a cube of sea-salt
is composed of other cubes, and that an
elm consists of other smaller elms, because, by
taking an end of a branch, or root, or a piece
of the wood separated from the trunk, or a seed,
they will alike produce a new tree. It is the
same with respect to polypuses, and some other
kinds of animals, which we can multiply by
cutting off, and separating any of the different
parts;<a name="FNanchor_BI_61" id="FNanchor_BI_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_BI_61" class="fnanchor">[BI]</a> and since our rule for judging in both
is the same, why should we judge differently of
them?</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_BI_61" id="Footnote_BI_61"></a><a href="#FNanchor_BI_61"><span class="label">[BI]</span></a> See Supplement to this Work, containing History of
Birds, Fish, Insects, &amp;c. vol. <span class="smcap">V.</span> p. 377.</p></div>

<p>It therefore appears very probable, by the
above reasons, that there really exists in nature
a number of small organized beings, alike, in
every respect, to the large organized bodies seen
in the world; that these small organized beings
are composed of living organic particles, which
are common to animals and vegetables, and are
their primitive and incompatible particles, that
the assemblage of these particles form an animal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
or plant, and consequently that reproduction, or
generation, is only a change of form made by
the addition of these resembling parts alone, and
that death or dissolution is nothing more than a
separation of the same particles. Of the truth
of this we apprehend there will not remain a
doubt, after reading the proofs we shall give in
the following chapters. Besides, if we reflect
on the manner in which trees grow, and consider
how so considerable a volume can arise from
so small an origin, we shall be convinced that it
proceeds from the simple addition of small resembling
organized particles. A grain produces
a young tree, which it contained in miniature.
At the summit of this small tree a bud is formed,
which contains the young tree for the succeeding
year, and this bud is an organic part, resembling
the young tree of the first year's
growth. A similar bud appears the second year,
containing a tree for the third; and thus, successively,
as long as the tree continues growing, at
the extremity of each branch new buds will
form, containing young trees like that of the
first year. Thus it is evident, that trees are
composed of small organized bodies, similar to
themselves, and that the whole individual is formed
by the union of small resembling individuals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>But, it may be asked, were not all these organized
bodies contained in the seed, and may
not the order of their expansion be traced from
that source, for the bud which first appeared was
evidently surmounted by another similar bud,
which was not expanded till the second year, and
soon to the third; and consequently the seed may
be said really to contain all the buds, or young
trees that would be produced for a hundred years,
or till the dissolution of the tree itself? This seed
it is also plain not only contained all the small organized
bodies which one day must constitute
the individual tree, but also every seed, every individual,
and every succession of seeds and individuals,
to the total destruction of the species.</p>

<p>This is the principal difficulty, and we shall
examine it with the strictest attention. It is
certain that the seed produces by the single
expansion of the bud, or germ, it contains, a
young tree the first year, and that this tree existed
in miniature in that bud, but it is not
equally certain that the bud of the second year,
and those of the succeeding, were all contained in
the first seed, no more than that every organized
body and seed, which must succeed to the
end of the world, or to the destruction of the
species, were so. This opinion supposes a progress
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
to infinity, and forms, of each individual, a
source of eternal generations. The first seed,
in that case, must have contained every plant of
its kind which have existed or ever will exist;
and the first man must actually and individually
have contained in his loins every man which has
or will appear on the face of the earth. Each
seed, and each animal, agreeable to this opinion,
must have possessed within an infinite posterity.
But the more we suffer ourselves to wander into
these kind of reasonings, the more we lose the
sight of truth in the labyrinth of infinity; and
instead of clearing up and solving the question,
we confuse and involve it in more obscurity; it
is placing the object out of sight, and afterwards
saying it is impossible to see it.</p>

<p>Let us investigate a little these ideas of infinite
progression and expansion. From whence
do they arise? What do they represent? The
ideas of infinity can only spring from an idea of
that which is limited, for it is in that manner
we have an idea of an infinity of succession, a
geometrical infinity: each individual is an unit,
many individuals compose a finite number, and
the whole species is the infinite multitude. Thus
in the same manner as a geometrical infinity
may be demonstrated not to exist, so we may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
assured that an infinite progression or expansion
does not exist; that it is only an abstract
idea, a retrenchment of the idea of finity, of
which we take away the limits that necessarily
terminate all size; and that, of course, we must
reject from philosophy every opinion which
leads to an idea of the actual existence of geometrical
or arithmetical infinity.</p>

<p>The partizans, therefore, of this opinion
must acknowledge, that their infinity of succession
and multiplication is, in fact, only an
indeterminate or indefinite number; a number
greater than any we can have an idea of, but
which is not infinite. This being granted,
they will tell us, that the first seed of an elm,
for example, which does not weigh a grain,
really contains all the organic particles necessary
for the formation of this, and every other
tree of the same kind which ever shall appear.
But what do they explain to us by this answer?
Is it not cutting the knot instead of untying
it, and eluding the question when it should be
resolved.</p>

<p>When we ask how beings are multiplied?
and it is answered that this multiplication was
compleatly made in the first body, is it not
acknowledging that they are ignorant how it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
made, and renouncing the will of conceiving
it? The question is asked, how one body produces
its like? and it is answered, that the
whole was created at once. Can we receive
this as a solution? for whether one or a million
of generations have passed the like difficulty
remains, and so far from explaining the supposition
of an indefinite number of germs,
increases the obscurity, and renders it incomprehensible.</p>

<p>I own, that in this circumstance, it is easier
to start objections than to establish probabilities,
and that the question of reproduction is of such
subtle nature, as possibly never to be fully resolved;
but then we should search whether it is
totally inscrutable, and by that examination,
we shall discover all that is possible to be
known of the subject; or at least, why we must
remain ignorant of it.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of questions, some belonging
to the first causes, the others have only
particular effects; for example, if it is asked,
why matter is impenetrable? it must either remain
unanswered, or be replied to by saying,
matter is impenetrable, because it is impenetrable.
It will be the same with respect to all
the general qualities of matter, whether relative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
to gravity, extension, motion or rest; no
other reply can be given, and we shall not be
surprised that such is the case, if we attentively
consider, that in order to give a reason for a
thing, we must have a different subject from
which we may deduce a comparison, and therefore
if the reason of a general cause is asked, that
is, of a quality which belongs to all in
general, and of which we have no subject to
which it does not belong, we are consequently
unable to reason upon it; from
thence it is demonstrable, it would be useless
to make such enquiries, since we should go
against the supposition that quality is general
and universal.</p>

<p>If, on the contrary, the reason of a particular
effect depends immediately on one of the
general causes above mentioned, and whether
it partakes of the general effect immediately,
or by a chain of other effects, the question
will be equally solved, provided we distinctly
perceive the dependence these effects have
on each other, and the connections there are
between them.</p>

<p>But if the particular effect, of which we
enquire the reason, does not appear to depend on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
these general effects, nor to have any analogy
with other known effects, then this effect,
being the only one of its kind, and having
nothing in common with other effects, at least
known to us, the question is insolvable: because,
not having, in this point, any known
subject which has any connection with that we
would explain, there is nothing from whence
we can draw the reason sought after. When
the reason of a general cause is demanded, it
is unanswerable, because it exists in every object;
and, on the other hand, the reason of a singular
or isolated effect is not found, because not any
thing known has the same qualities. We cannot
explain the reason of a general effect,
without discovering one more general; whereas
the reason of an isolated effect may be explained
by the discovery of some other relative effect,
which although we are ignorant of at present,
chance or experience may bring to light.</p>

<p>Besides these, there is another kind of question,
which may be called, the question of fact.
For example. Why do trees, dogs, &amp;c. exist?
All these fact questions are totally insoluble, for
those who answer them by final causes do not
consider that they take the effect for the cause;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
the connection particular objects have with us
having no influence on their origin. Moral
affinity can never become a physical reason.</p>

<p>We must carefully distinguish these questions
where the <i>why</i> is used, from those where the
<i>how</i> is employed, and more so from those
where the <i>how many</i> is mentioned. <i>Why</i> is
always relative to the cause of the effect, or to
the effect itself. <i>How</i> is relative to the mode
from which the effect springs, and the <i>how
many</i> has relation only to the proportionate
quantity of the effect.</p>

<p>All these distinctions being explained, let us
proceed to examine the question concerning
the reproduction of bodies. If it is asked,
why animals and vegetables reproduce? we
shall clearly discover, that this being a question
of fact, it is insolvable, and useless to endeavour
at the solution of it. But if it is asked,
<i>how</i> animals and vegetables reproduce; we
reply by relating the history of the generation
of every species of animal, and of the reproduction
of each distinct vegetable; but, after
having run over all the methods of an animal
engendering its resemblance, accompanied even
with the most exact observations, we shall find
it has only taught us facts without indicating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
causes; and that the apparent methods which
Nature makes use of for reproduction, do
not appear to have any connection with the
effects resulting therefrom; we shall be still
obliged to ask, what is the secret mode by which
she enables different bodies to propagate their
own species?</p>

<p>This question is very different from the first
and second; it gives liberty of enquiry and
admits the employment of imagination, and
therefore is not insolvable, for it does not immediately
belong to a general cause; nor is it
entirely a question of fact, for provided we
can conceive a mode of reproduction dependent
upon, or not repugnant to, original causes, we
shall have gained a satisfactory answer; and
the more it shall have a connection with other
effects of nature, the better foundation will it
be raised upon.</p>

<p>By the question itself it is, therefore, permitted
to form hypotheses, and to select that
which shall appear to have the greatest analogy
with the other phenomena of nature. But
we must exclude from the number all those
which supposes the thing already done; for
example, such as suppose that all the germs of
the same species were contained in the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
seed, or that every reproduction is a new creation,
and immediate effect of the Almighty's
will; because these hypotheses are questions of
fact, and on which it is impossible to reason.
We must also reject every hypothesis which
might have final causes for its object; such as,
we might say, that reproduction is made in
order for the living to supply the place of the
dead, that the earth may be always covered
with vegetables, and peopled with animals;
that man may find plenty for his subsistence,
&amp;c. because these hypotheses, instead of explaining
the effects by physical causes, are
founded only on arbitrary connections and
moral agreements. At the same time we must
not rely on these absolute axioms and physical
problems, which so many people have improperly
made use of, as principles; for example,
there is no fecundation made apart from the
body, <i>nulla f&#339;condatio extra corpus</i>; every
living thing is produced from an egg; all
generation supposes sexes, &amp;c. We must not
take these maxims in an absolute sense, but
consider them only as signifying things generally
performed in one particular mode rather
than in any other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us, therefore, search after an hypothesis
which has not any of those defects, and by
which we cannot fall into any of these inconveniences;
if, then, we do not succeed in the
explanation of the mechanical power Nature
makes use of to effect the reproduction of
beings, we shall, at least, arrive at something
more probable than what has hitherto been advanced.</p>

<p>As we can make moulds, by which we can
give to the external parts of bodies whatever
figure we please, let us suppose Nature can
form the same, by which she not only bestows
on bodies the external figure but also the internal.
Would not this be one mode by which
reproduction may be performed?</p>

<p>Let us, then, consider on what foundation
this supposition is raised: let us examine if it
contains any thing contradictory, and afterwards
we shall discover what consequences
may be derived from it. Though our senses
are only judges of the external parts of bodies,
we perfectly comprehend external affection
and different figures. We can also imitate
Nature, by representing external figures by
different modes, as by painting, sculpture, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
moulds; but although our senses are only
judges of external qualities, we know there are
internal qualities, some of which are general,
as gravity. This quality, or power, does not
act relatively to surfaces, but proportionably to
the masses, or quantities of matter; there is,
therefore, very active qualities in Nature,
which even penetrate bodies to the most internal
parts; but we shall never gain a perfect
idea of these qualities, because, not being
external, they cannot fall within the compass
of our senses; but we can compare their effects,
and deduce analogies therefrom, to answer for
the effect of similar qualities.</p>

<p>If our eyes, instead of representing to us
the surface of objects only, were so formed as
to shew us the internal parts alone, we should
then have clear ideas of the latter, without the
smallest knowledge of the former. In this
supposition the internal moulds, which I have
supposed to be made use of by Nature, might
be as easily seen and conceived as the moulds
for external figures. In that case we should
have modes of imitating the internal parts of
bodies as we now have for the external. These
internal moulds, although we cannot acquire,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
Nature may be possessed of, as she is of the
qualities of gravity, which penetrate to the
internal particles of matter. The supposition
of these moulds being formed on good analogies
it only remains for us to examine if it includes
any contradiction.</p>

<p>It may be argued that the expression of <i>an
internal mould</i> includes two contradictory ideas;
that the idea of a mould can only be related to
the surface, and that the internal, according to
this, must have a connection with the whole
mass, and, therefore, it might as well be called
a massive surface as an internal mould.</p>

<p>I admit, that when we are about to represent
ideas which have not hitherto been expressed,
we are obliged to make use of terms which
seem contradictory; for this reason philosophers
have often employed foreign terms on such
occasions, instead of applying those in common
use, and which have a received signification;
but this artifice is useless, since we
can shew the opposition is only in the words,
and that there is nothing contradictory in the
idea. Now I affirm that a simple idea cannot
contain a contradiction, that is, when we can
form an idea of a thing; if this idea is simple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
it cannot be compounded; it cannot include
any other idea, and, consequently, it will contain
nothing opposite nor contrary.</p>

<p>Simple ideas are not only the primary apprehensions
which strike us by the senses, but also
the primary comparisons which form from
those apprehensions; for the first apprehension,
itself is always a comparison. The idea of
the size of an object, or of its remoteness,
necessarily includes a comparison with bulk or
distance in general; therefore, when an idea
only includes comparison it must be regarded
as simple, and from that circumstance, as containing
nothing contradictory. Such is the
idea of the internal mould. There is a quality
in Nature, called <i>gravity</i>, which penetrates the
internal parts of bodies. I take the idea of
internal mould relatively to this quality, and,
therefore, including only comparison, it bears
not any contradiction.</p>

<p>Let us now see the consequences that may
be deduced from this supposition; let us also
search after facts corresponding therewith, as
it will become so much the more probable, as
the number of analogies shall be greater.
Let us begin by unfolding this idea of internal
moulds, and by explaining in what manner we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
understand it, we shall be brought to conceive
the modes of reproduction.</p>

<p>Nature, in general, seems to have a greater
tendency to life than death, and to organize
bodies as much as possible; the multiplication
of germs, which may be infinitely encreased,
is a proof of it; and we may assert with safety,
that if all matter is not organized, it is because
organized beings destroy each other; or we
can augment as much as we please the quantity
of living and vegetating beings, but we
cannot augment the quantity of stones or other
inanimate matters. This seems to indicate
that the most common work of Nature is the
production of the organic part, and in which
her power knows no bounds.</p>

<p>To render this intelligible, let us make a
calculation of what a single germ might produce.
The seed of an elm, which does not
weigh the hundredth part of an ounce, at the
end of 100 years will produce a tree whose
volume will be 60 cubic feet. At the tenth
year this tree will have produced 1000 seeds,
which being all sown, at the end of 100 years
would each have also a volume equal to 60
cubic feet. Thus in 110 years there is produced
more than 60,000 cubic feet of organized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
matter; 10 years more there will be
10,000,000 of fathoms, without including the
10,000 encreased every year, which would
make 100,000 more; and ten years after there
will be three times that number; thus in 130
years a single shoot will produce a volume of
organized matter, which would fill up a space
of 1000 cubic leagues; 10 years after it would
comprehend a 1,000,000, and in 10 years
more 1,000,000 times 1,000,000 cubic leagues;
so that in 150 years the whole terrestrial
globe might be entirely converted into one
single kind of organized matter. In this production
of organized body Nature would
know no bounds, if it were not for the resistance
of matters which are not susceptible of
organization, and this proves that she does not
incline to form inanimate but organized beings,
and that in this she never stops but when irresistible
inconveniences are opposed thereto.
What we have already said on the seed of an
elm may be said of any other; and it would be
easy to demonstrate, that if we were to hatch
every egg produced by hens for the space of
30 years, there would be a sufficient number of
fowls to cover the whole surface of the earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>These kind of calculations demonstrate that
organic formation is the most common work of
Nature, and, apparently, that which costs her
the least labour. But I will go farther; the
general division which we ought to make of
matter seems to me to be in <i>living</i> and <i>dead
matter</i>, instead of organized and brute; the
brute is only that matter produced by the death
of animals or vegetables; I could prove it by
that enormous quantity of shells, and other
cast-off matters of living animals, which compose
the principal part of stones, marble, chalk,
marle, earth, turf, and other substances, which
we call brute matter, and which are only the
ruins of dead animals or vegetables; but a
reflection, which seems to me well founded,
will, perhaps, make it better understood.</p>

<p>Having meditated on the activity of Nature
to produce organized bodies, and seen that
her power, in this respect, is not limited; having
proved that infinity of organic living particles,
which constitute life, must exist; having
shewn that the living body costs the least
trouble to Nature, I now search after the principal
causes of death and destruction, and I
find that bodies in general, which have the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
power of converting matter into their proper
substance, and to assimilate the parts of other
bodies, are the greatest destroyers. Fire, for
example, turns into its own substance almost
every species of matter, and is the greatest
means of destruction known to us. Animals
seem to participate of the qualities of flame;
their internal heat is a kind of fire; therefore,
after fire, animals are the greatest destroyers,
and they assimilate and convert into their own
substance every matter which may serve them
for food: but although these two causes of destruction
are very considerable, and their effects
perpetually incline to the annihilation of organized
beings, the cause of reproduction is infinitely
more powerful and active; she seems
to borrow, even from destruction itself, means
to multiply, since assimilation, which is one
cause of death, is at the same time a necessary
means of producing life.</p>

<p>To destroy an organized being is, as we
have observed, only to separate the organic
particles of which it is composed; these particles
remain separated till they are re-united
by some active power. But what is this active
power?&mdash;It is the power which animals and
vegetables have to assimilate the matter that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
serves them for food; and is not this the same,
or at least has it not great connection with that
which is the cause of reproduction?</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<p class="caption2"><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></p>

<p class="caption3">OF NUTRITION AND GROWTH.</p>


<p>The body of an animal is a kind of internal
mould, in which the nutritive matter
assimilates itself with the whole in such a
manner that, without changing the order and
proportion of the parts, each receives an augmentation,
and it is this augmentation of bulk
which some have called <i>expansion</i>, because they
imagined every difficulty would be removed by
the supposition that the animal was completely
formed in the embryo, and that it would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
easy to conceive that its parts would expand,
or unfold in proportion as it would increase by
the addition of accessory matter.</p>

<p>But if we would have a clear idea of this
augmentation and expansion, how can it be
done otherwise than by considering the animal
body, and each of its parts, as so many internal
moulds which receive the accessory matter in
the order that results from the position of all
their parts? This expansion cannot be made by
the addition to the surfaces alone, but, on the
contrary, by an intimate susception which penetrates
the mass, and thus increases the size of
the parts, without changing the form, from
whence it is necessary that the matter which
serves for this expansion should penetrate the
internal part in all its dimensions; it is also as
necessary that this penetration be made in a
certain order and proportion, so that no one
point can receive more than another, without
which some parts would expand quicker than
others, and the form be entirely changed.
Now what can prescribe this rule to accessory
matter, and constrain it to arrive perpetually
and proportionally to every point of the internal
parts, except we conceive an internal
mould?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>It therefore appears certain that the body of
an animal or vegetable is an internal mould of
a constant form, but where their masses may
augment proportionably, by the extension of
this mould in all its external and internal dimensions.
That this extension also is made
by the intus-susception of any accessory or
foreign matter which penetrates the internal
part, and becomes similar to the form and
identical substance with the matter of the
moulds themselves.</p>

<p>But of what nature is this matter which the
animal or vegetable assimilates with its own
substance? what can be the nature of that
power which gives it the activity and necessary
motion to penetrate the internal mould? and
if such a power does exist, must it not be
similar to that by which the internal mould
itself would be produced?</p>

<p>These three questions include all that can be
desired on this subject, and seem to depend on
each other so much, that I am persuaded the
reproduction of an animal or vegetable cannot
be explained in a satisfactory manner, if a
clear idea of the mode of the operation of
nutrition is not obtained; we must, therefore,
examine these three questions separately, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
order to compare the consequences resulting
therefrom.</p>

<p>The first, which relates to the nutritive nature
of this matter, is in part resolved by the
reasons we have already given, and will be
fully demonstrated in the succeeding chapter.
We will shew that there exists an infinity of
living organic particles in Nature; that their
production is of little expence to Nature,
since their existence is constant and invariable,
and that the causes of death only separate
without destroying them. Therefore the matter
which the animal or vegetable assimilates
is an organic matter of the same nature as the
animal or vegetable itself, and which consequently
can augment the size without changing
the form or quality of the matter of the
mould, since it is in fact of the same form
and quality as that which it is constituted
with. Thus, in the quantity of aliments which
the animal takes to support life, and to keep
its organs in play, and in the sap, which the
vegetable takes up by its roots and leaves,
there is a great part thrown off by transpiration,
secretion, and other excretory modes, and
only a small portion retained for the nourishment
of the parts and their expansion. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
very probable, that in the body of an animal
or vegetable there is formed a separation of the
brute particles of the aliments and the organic;
that the first are carried off by the causes just
mentioned; that only organic particles remain,
and that the distribution of them is made by
means of some active power which conducts
them to every part in an exact proportion,
insomuch that neither receive more or less than
is needful for its equal nutrition, growth, or
expansion.</p>

<p>The second question, What can be the active
power which causes this organic matter to penetrate
and incorporate itself with this internal
mould? By the preceding chapter it appears,
that there exists in Nature powers relative to
the internal part of matter, and which have no
relation with its external qualities. These
powers, as already observed, will never come
under our cognizance, because their action is
made on the internal part of the body, whereas
our senses cannot reach beyond what is external;
it is therefore evident, that we shall never
have a clear idea of the penetrating powers, nor
of the manner by which they act; but it is not
less certain that they exist, than that by their
means most effects of Nature are produced;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
we must attribute to them the effects of nutrition
and expansion, which cannot be effected
by any other means than the penetration of the
most intimate recesses of the original mould: in
the same mode as gravity penetrates all parts
of matter, so the power which impels or attracts
the organic particles of food, penetrates into
the internal parts of organized bodies, and as
those bodies have a certain form, which we
call the internal mould, the organic particles,
impelled by the action of the penetrating force,
cannot enter therein but in a certain order relative
to this form, which consequently it cannot
change, but only augment its dimensions,
and thus produce the growth of organized bodies;
and if in the organized body, expanded
by this means, there are some particles whose
external and internal forms are like that of the
whole body, from those reproduction will proceed.</p>

<p>The third question, Is it not by a similar
power the internal mould itself is reproduced?
It appears, that it is not only a similar but the
same power which causes expansion and reproduction,
for in an organized body which expands,
if there is some particle like the whole,
it is sufficient for that particle to become one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
day an organized body itself, perfectly similar
to that of which it made a part. This particle
will not at first present a figure striking enough
for us to compare with the whole body; but
when separated from that body, and receiving
proper nourishment, it will begin to expand,
and in a short time present a similar being, both
externally and internally, as the body from
which it had been separated: thus a willow or
polypus, which contain more organic particles
similar to the whole than most other substances,
if cut into ever such a number of pieces, from
each piece will spring a body similar to that
from whence it was divided.</p>

<p>Now in a body, every particle of which is
like itself, the organization is the most simple,
as we have observed in the first chapter; for it
is only the repetition of the same form, and a
composition of similar figures, all organized
alike. It is for this reason that the most simple
bodies, or the most imperfect kinds, are reproduced
with the greatest ease, and in the greatest
plenty; whereas, if an organized body contains
only some few particles like itself, then, as
such alone can arrive to the second expansion,
consequently the reproduction will be more
difficult, and not so abundant in number; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
organization of these bodies will also be more
compounded, because the more the organized
parts differ from the whole, the more the organization
of this body will be perfect, and the
more difficult the production will be.</p>

<p>Nourishment, expansion, and propagation,
then, are the effects of one and the same cause.
The organized body is nourished by the particles
of aliments analogous to it; it expands by the
intimate susception of organical parts which
agree with it, and it propagates because it contains
some original particles which resemble itself.
It only remains to examine, whether these
similar organic particles come into the organized
body by nutriment, or whether they were
there before, and have an independent existence.
If we suppose the latter, we shall fall in with
the doctrine of the infinity of parts, or similar
germs contained one in the other; the insufficiency
and absurdity of which hypothesis we
have already shewn; we must therefore conclude
that similar parts are extracted from the
food; and after what has been said, we hope to
explain the manner in which the organic molecules
are formed, and how the minute particles
unite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>There is, as we have said, a separation of
the parts in the nutriment; the organic from
those analogous to the animal or vegetable, by
transpiration and other excretory modes; the
organical remain and serve for the expansion
and nutriment of the body. But these organic
parts must be of various kinds, and as each
part of the body receives only those similar to
itself, and that in due proportion, it is very
natural to imagine, that the superfluity of this organic
matter will be sent back from every part of
the body into one or more places, where all these
organical molecules uniting, form small organized
bodies like the first, and to which nothing
is wanting but the mode of expansion for
them to become individuals of the same species;
for every part of the body sending back organized
parts, like those of which they themselves
are composed, it is necessary, that from the
union of all these parts, there should result organized
bodies like the first. This being admitted,
may we not conclude this is the reason
why, during the time of expansion and growth,
organized bodies cannot produce, because the
parts which expand absorb the whole of the
organic molecules which belong to them, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
not having any superfluous parts, consequently
are incapable of reproduction.</p>

<p>This explanation of nutrition and reproduction
will not probably be received by those
who admit but of a certain number of mechanical
principles, and reject all which do
not depend on them; and as what has been
said of nutrition and expansion comes under
the latter description, they will possibly treat
it as unworthy dependance. But I am quite of
a different opinion from these philosophers;
for it appears to me that, by admitting only
a certain number of mechanical principles,
they do not see how greatly they contract the
bounds of philosophy, and that for one phenomenon
that can be explained by a system so
confined, a thousand would be found exceeding
its limits.</p>

<p>The idea of explaining every phenomenon
in nature by mechanical principles was certainly
a great and beautiful exertion, and which
Descartes first attempted. But this idea is only a
project, and if properly founded, have we the
means of performing it? These mechanical
principles are the extent of matter, its impenetrability,
its motion, its external figure, its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
divisibility, and the communication of movement
by impulsion, by elasticity, &amp;c. The
particular ideas of each of these qualities we
have acquired by our senses, and regard them as
principles, because they are general and belong
to all matter. But are we certain these qualities
are the only ones which matter possesses,
or rather, must we not think these qualities,
which we take for principles, are only modes
of perception; and that if our senses were
differently formed, we should discover in matter,
qualities different from those which we
have enumerated? To admit only those qualities
to matter which are known to us, seems
to be a vain and unfounded pretension. Matter
may have many general qualities which we
shall ever be ignorant of; she may also have
others that human assiduity may discover, in
the same manner as has recently been done
with respect to gravity, which alike exists in
all matter. The cause of impulsion, and such
other mechanical principles, will always be
as impossible to find out as that of attraction,
or such other general quality. From hence is
it not very reasonable to say, that mechanical
principles are nothing but general effects,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
which experience has pointed out to us in
matter, and that every time a new general
effect is discovered, either by reflection, comparison,
measure, or experience, a new mechanical
principle will be gained, which may
be used with as much certainty and advantage
as any we are now acquainted with?</p>

<p>The defect of Aristotle's philosophy was
making use of particular effects as common
causes; and that of Descartes in making use
of only a few general effects as causes, and
excluding all the rest. The philosophy which
appears to me would be the least deficient, is
that where general effects are only made use of
for causes, and seeking to augment the number
of them, by endeavouring to generalize particular
effects.</p>

<p>In my explanation of expansion and reproduction,
I admit the received mechanical principles,
the penetrating force of weight, and, by
analogy, I have strove to point out that there
are other penetrating powers existing in organized
bodies, which experience has confirmed.
I have proved by facts, that matter
inclines to organization, and that there exists
an infinite number of organic particles. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
have therefore only generalized some observations,
without having advanced any thing
contrary to mechanical principles, when that
term is used as it ought to be understood, as
denoting the general effects of Nature.</p>

<p class="caption3">OF THE GENERATION OF ANIMALS.</p>


<p>As human and animal organization is the
most perfect and compounded, their propagation
is also the most difficult and least abundant;
I here except those animals which, like
the fresh-water polypus or worms, are reproduced
from their divided parts, as trees are by
slips, or plants by their divided roots or
suckers; also those which may be found to multiply
without copulation; it appears to me that
the nature of those have been sufficiently explained
in the preceding chapter; and from
which, in every kind where an individual produces
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
its resemblance, it is easy to deduce the
explanation of the reproduction from expansion
and nutrition.</p>

<p>But how shall we apply this mode of reasoning
to the generation of man and animals
distinguished by sexes, and where the concurrence
of two individuals is required? We
understand, by what has just been advanced,
how each individual can produce its like; but
we do not conceive how a male and a female
produces a third.</p>

<p>Before I answer this question, I cannot avoid
observing, that all those who have written upon
this subject have confined their systems to the
generation of man and animals, without paying
any attention to other kinds of generation
which Nature presents us with, and reproduction
in general; and as the generation of man
and animals is the most complicated of all
kinds, their researches have been attended
with great disadvantages, not only by attacking
the most difficult point, but also by having no
subject of comparison, from which they could
draw a solution of the question. To this it is
that I principally attribute the little success
of their labours; but by the road I have taken
we may arrive at the explanation of the phenomena
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
of every kind of generation in a satisfactory
manner.</p>

<p>The generation of man will serve us for an
example. I take him in his infancy, and I
conceive that the expansion and growth of the
different parts of his body being made by the
intimate penetration of organic molecules
analogous to each of its parts, all these organic
molecules are absorbed in his earliest years, and
serve only for the expansion and augmentation
of his various members, consequently there
is little or no superfluity until the expansion
is entirely completed; and this is the reason
why children are incapable of propagation;
but when the body has attained the greatest
part of its growth, it begins to have no longer
need of so great a quantity of organic particles,
and the superfluity, therefore, is sent back from
each part of the body into the destined reservoirs
for its reception. These reservoirs are
the testicles and seminal vessels, and it is at this
period that the expansion of the body is
nearly completed, when the commencement
of puberty is dated, and every circumstance
indicates the superabundance of nutriment;
the voice alters and takes a deeper tone; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
beard begins to appear, and other parts of the
body are covered with hair; those parts which
are appointed for generation take a quick
growth; the seminal liquor fills the prepared
reservoirs, and when the plentitude is too great,
even without any provocation, and during the
time of sleep, it emits from the body. In
the female this superabundance is more strongly
marked, it discovers itself by periodical evacuation,
which begin and end with the faculty
of propagating, by the quick growth of the
breasts, and by an attraction in the sexual parts,
as shall be explained.</p>

<p>I think, therefore, that the organical molecules,
sent from every part of the body into
the testicles and seminal vessels of the male,
and into the ovarium of the female, forms
there the seminal liquor, which is, as has been
observed, in both sexes, a kind of extract of
every part of the body. These organical
molecules, instead of uniting and forming an
individual, like the one in which they are contained,
can only unite when the seminal liquors
of the two sexes are mixed; and when there is
more organical molecules of the male than of
the female, in such mixture the produce will be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
a male; and, on the contrary, when there is
more of the female then a female will be the
result.</p>

<p>I do not mean to say that the organic molecules
of either could unite to form small organized
bodies of themselves, but that it is necessary
a mixture of the seminal fluid of both
sexes should take place, and that it is only those
formed in that mixture which can expand and
become individuals. These small moving
bodies, called <i>spermatic animals</i>, are seen, by a
microscope, in the seminal liquor of every
male, and are, probably, small organized bodies,
proceeding from the individual which contains
them, but which cannot expand or produce
any thing of themselves. We shall evince
that there are the same in the seminal liquor of
the female, and shall indicate the place where
this liquor is to be found.</p>

<p>It is very possible that organical molecules
are, at first, only a kind of f&#339;tus of a small
organized body, in which there are only essential
parts. We shall not enter into a detail of
proofs, in this respect, but content ourselves
with remarking, that the pretended spermatic
animals, which we have been speaking of,
might possibly be but imperfectly organized,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
or that these pretended animals are only living
organic particles, common both to animals and
vegetables, or, at most, only the first union of
those particles.</p>

<p>But let us return to our principal object.
How can we conceive, it may be asked, that
the superfluous particles can be sent back from
every part of the body, and afterwards unite
when the seminal liquor of the two sexes are
mixed? Besides, is it certain that this mixture
is made? Has it not been pretended that the
female did not furnish any fluid of this kind?
Is it certain that the liquor of the male enters
the matrix, &amp;c.</p>

<p>To the first question I answer, if what I
have said on the subject of the penetration of
the internal mould by organic molecules, in
nutrition or expansion, be well understood, it
will easily be conceived that these molecules,
not being able any longer to penetrate those
parts they did before, they will be necessitated
to take a different road, and consequently arrive
at some part, as the testicles or seminal vessels;
for to explain the animal economy, and the
different movements of the human body, solely
by mechanical principles, is the same as if a
man would give an account of a picture by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
shutting his eyes and feeling on it; for it is
evident that neither the circulation of the
blood, nor the motion of the muscles, nor the
animal functions, can be explained by impulsion,
nor other common laws of mechanics:
it is as evident that nutrition, expansion, and
reproduction, is made by other laws, why
therefore not admit of acting and penetrating
powers on the masses of bodies, since we have
examples of it in gravity, in magnetical attractions,
and in chemical affinities? And as we
are now convinced by facts, and the multitude
of constant and uniform observations, that
there exists in nature powers which do not
act by the mode of impulsion, why should we
not make use of those powers as mechanical
principles? Why should we exclude them from
the explanations of effects, which we are convinced
they produce? Why should we be confined
to employ only the power of impulsion?
Is not this like judging of a picture by the
touch, and explaining the phenomena of the
mass by those of the surface, and the penetrating
power by superficial action? Is not this
making use of one sense instead of another;
and, on the whole, is it not confining the faculty
of reasoning on a small number of mechanical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
principles, totally inadequate to follow
the various productions of nature.</p>

<p>But those penetrating powers being once
admitted, is it not natural to suppose that the
most analogous particles will unite and bind
themselves intimately together; that each part
of the body will appropriate the most agreeable
to itself, and that from the superfluity of all
these particles there will be formed a seminal
fluid, which will contain all the organic molecules
necessary to form a small organized body,
perfectly like that from which this fluid is extracted?
A power like that which was necessary
to make them penetrate into each part,
and produce expansion, may be sufficient to
collect them in an organized form, like that of
the body in which they originated.</p>

<p>I conceive, that in the aliments we take
there is a great quantity of organical molecules,
which needs no serious proof, since we
live on animals and vegetables, which are organized
substances. In the stomach and intestines
a separation is made of the gross parts,
which are thrown off by the excretories. The
chyle, which is the purest part of the aliment,
enters into the lacteal vessels, and from thence
is transported into every part of the body.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
By the motion of the circulation it purifies
itself from all inorganical molecules, which are
thrown off by secretion and transpiration; but
the organic particles remain, because they are
analogous to the blood, and that from thence
there is a power of affinity which retains them
afterwards; for as the whole mass of blood
passes many times through the body, I apprehend,
that in this continual circulation every
particular part of the body attracts the particles
most analogous to it, without interrupting the
course of the others. In this manner every
part is expanded and nourished, not, as it is
commonly said, by a simple addition of the
parts, and a superficial increase, but by an intimate
penetration of substance, produced by a
power which acts on every point of the mass;
and when the parts of the body are at a certain
growth, and almost filled with these analogous
particles, as their substance is become more
solid, I conceive they then lose the faculty of
attracting or receiving those particles, but as
the circulation will continue to carry them to
every part of the body, which not being any
longer able to admit them as before, must necessarily
be deposited in some particular part,
as in the testicles or seminal vessels. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
fluid extract of the male, when mixed with
that of the female, the similar particles, possessing
a penetrating force, unite and form a
small organized body like one of the two
sexes, and no more than expansion is wanting
to render it a similar individual, and which it
afterwards receives in the womb of the female.</p>

<p>The second question, Whether the female
has really a seminal liquor similar to the male?
demands some discussion. I shall first observe,
as a certain matter, that if such a fluid exists, the
manner in which the emission of the female is
made is not so apparent as by the male, being
in general retained within the body.<a name="FNanchor_BJ_62" id="FNanchor_BJ_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_BJ_62" class="fnanchor">[BJ]</a> The
ancients so little doubted of the female having
a seminal liquor, that it was by the different
mode of its emission that they distinguished the
male from the female. But physicians, who
have endeavoured to explain generation by the
egg, or by spermatic animalcules, insinuate
that females have no particular fluid, that we
have been deceived by taking the mucus for
the seminal, and that the supposition of the
ancients upon this subject was destitute of all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
foundation. Nevertheless this fluid does exist,
and it has only been doubted by those who
chose to give way to systems, and from the
difficulty of discovering the parts which serve
for its reservoirs. The fluid which issues
from the glands at the neck of the womb, and
at the orifice of the urethra, has no apparent
reservoir, and as it flows outwardly it cannot
be thought to be the prolific liquor, since it
cannot concur in the formation of the f&#339;tus
which is performed within the matrix. The
prolific fluid of the female must have a reservoir
in another part. It flows even in great
plenty, although such a quantity is not necessary,
no more than in the male, for the production
of the embryo. It is sufficient for
propagation if ever so little of the male fluid
enters the matrix, so it meets with the smallest
drop of that of the female; therefore the observations
of some anatomists, who have pretended
that the seminal liquor of the male does not
enter the womb, makes nothing against what
we have advanced, especially as other anatomists,
who rely on observations, have pretended
the contrary. But the subject will be better
discussed in the subsequent pages.</p>

jacit, mas, Aristotle, art. 18 de Animalibus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p></div>

<p>Having thus given answers to possible objections,
let us now look into the reasons
which may serve as proofs to our explanation.
The first is derived from the analogy there is
between expansion and reproduction; expansion
cannot be explained in a satisfactory
manner, without employing those penetrating
powers, and those affinities or attractions we
have already made use of to explain the formation
of small organized beings, resembling
the great ones which contain them. A second
analogy is, that nutrition and reproduction are
both not only produced by the same efficient,
but also by the same material cause, the organic
particles of the nutriment. And a proof
that it is the superfluity of those particles which
serves for reproduction, is the body not being
in a condition to propagate before they have
done growing; and we daily see in dogs, and
other animals, who more exactly follow the
laws of nature than we, that they nearly attain
their full growth before they attempt to copulate,
and by which we may know whether a
dog will increase any more or not; for we may
be assured he will not after being in a condition
to engender.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>It is another proof that the superfluous nutriment
forms the seminal liquor, that eunuchs,
and all mutilated animals, grow larger or
thicker than those who have not that deficiency.
The superabundance of nutriment not being
able to evacuate, for the defect of proper organs,
alters the habit of the body; the thighs
and haunches of eunuchs grow very large: the
reason is evident; after their body has attained
the common size, if the superfluous organic
molecules found an issue, as in other men, this
growth would no longer increase; but as there
are no longer organs for the emission of the
seminal fluid, which is no more than the superfluous
matter which served for growth remains,
it endeavours to expand the parts beyond
their usual dimensions. Now it is known,
that the growth of the bones is made by the
extremities, which are soft and spongy, and
when they have once acquired solidity, they
are no longer capable of extension; and for this
reason, the superfluous organic particles can
only expand the spongy extremities of bones,
which causes the thighs, knees, &amp;c. of eunuchs
to thicken so considerably.</p>

<p>But what more strongly proves the truth of
our explanation, is the resemblance of children
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
to their parents. A son, in general, more
resembles his father than his mother, and the
daughter more her mother than her father;
because a man has a greater resemblance to a
man than to a woman, and a woman resembles
more a woman than a man, in respect to the
whole habitude of the body; but for the features
and particular habits, children sometimes
resemble the father, sometimes the mother, and
sometimes both. They will have, for example,
the father's eyes, and the mouth of the mother,
or the complexion of the latter, and the size
of the former; which is impossible to be conceived,
unless it is admitted that both parents
have contributed to the formation of the child,
and that consequently there was a mixture of
the two seminal fluids.</p>

<p>I acknowledge that resemblances raised many
difficulties in my own mind; before I had maturely
examined the question of generation, I
was prepossessed with ideas of a mixed system,
by which it appeared that I could explain
in a probable manner every phenomena, excepting
resemblances, and these I thought I
had found very specious reasons to doubt, and
which deceived me a long time, until having
minutely observed, with all the exactness I was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
capable of, a great number of families, and
especially the most numerous, I have not been
able to resist the multiplicity of proofs; it is
only after being fully convinced in this respect,
that I have began to think differently,
and to credit what I now believe to be the
fact.</p>

<p>Besides, although I had found the mode to
avoid those arguments that would be made on
the subject of mulattos, mongrels, and mules,
I could not be prevented from observing that
every explanation, where a reason could be
given for the phenomena, cannot be satisfactory;
and I am now perfectly convinced that
the objections which might be used with respect
to them, as well as particular parental
resemblances, instead of opposing would confirm
my explanation.</p>

<p>I now proceed to draw some consequences.
In youth the seminal fluid is less abundant,
although more stimulating; its quantity encreases
to a certain age, because in proportion
as we approach that age, the parts of the body
become more solid, admit less nutriment, send
back a greater quantity to the common reservoirs,
and consequently produce a greater
abundance of seminal fluid. When the external
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
organs have not been used, persons of a
middling age, and even old men, more easily
engender than young ones. This is evident
in the vegetable system, the older a tree is, the
more fruit or seed it produces.</p>

<p>Young people who emit, or force irritation,
draw a greater quantity of seminal fluid towards
the organs of generation than would naturally
arrive there, the consequence is, they cease from
growing, become thin, and fall at length into
consumptions, and that because they lose by
premature, and too often reiterated evacuations,
the necessary substance for the growth and nutrition
of every part of the body.</p>

<p>Those whose bodies are thin without emaciation,
or fleshy without being fat, are the
most vigorous; as soon as the superabundant
nutriment has begun to form fat, it is always
at the expence of the seminal fluid, and other
faculties of generation. When also, not only
the growth of every part of the body is entirely
completed, but the bones are grown
solid, the cartilages begin to ossify, the membranes
have received all the solidity possible,
the fibres are become hard and rough, and
at length every part of the body can no
longer scarcely admit of nutriment, the fat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
considerably increases, and the quantity of seminal
fluid diminishes, because the superfluous
particles, stopped in every part of the body, and
the fibres, having no longer any suppleness or
elasticity, cannot return it into the reservoirs of
generation.</p>

<p>The seminal liquor not only becomes more
abundant till a certain age, but it also becomes
thicker, and contains a greater quantity of
matter under the same bulk. A person, very
observant in this point, assured me that the seminal
fluid is as heavy again as the blood, and
consequently specifically heavier than any other
fluid of the body.</p>

<p>When a man is in good health the evacuation
of this fluid produces an appetite, and he soon
feels the necessity of repairing, by a new nutriment,
the loss of the old; from whence it may be
concluded, that the most efficacious check to
every kind of luxury is abstinence and fasting.</p>

<p>A number of other things remain to be said
on this subject, but which I have treated of in
the History of Man; however, before I entirely
close, I shall make some few observations.
The greatest part of animals do not
seek for copulation until they are nearly arrived
at their full growth; those which have only a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
particular season in the year have only seminal
liquor at that time. A very capable observer
of Nature<a name="FNanchor_BK_63" id="FNanchor_BK_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_BK_63" class="fnanchor">[BK]</a> not only saw this liquor forming
in the roe of a Calmar, but even observed the
spermatic animals and the roe itself, which
have no existence till the month of October,
the time when the Calmar spawns on the coast
of Portugal, where Mr. Needham made these
observations. As soon as the season is over
neither seminal liquor nor spermatic animals
are longer seen in the milt, which then dries up
and becomes imperceptible till the season returns
in the succeeding year, when the superfluous
nutriment renews the milt, and fills it as
before. In the history of the stag we have an
opportunity of remarking on the different effects
of rutting; the most general is, the increased
size of the animal; and in those kinds
of animals whose rutting or spawning is only
made at great intervals, the extenuation of the
body is proportionably great.</p>

<div class="footnote">

1745.</p></div>

<p>As women are smaller and weaker than
men, of a more delicate temperament, and eat
much less, it is natural to imagine that their
superfluous organic particles are not so plentiful;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
from hence their seminal liquor will be
weaker, and less in quantity, than that of men.
Since, likewise, the seminal liquor of females
contains fewer organic particles than that of
males, must there not result a greater number
of males than females from the mixture of
these two liquors? This is really the case, for
which it has hitherto been thought impossible
to find a reason. About a sixteenth more male
children are born than females; and we find
that the same cause produces the same effect in
all kinds of animals on which we have been able
to make this observation.</p>

<p>Plato<a name="FNanchor_BL_64" id="FNanchor_BL_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_BL_64" class="fnanchor">[BL]</a> not only explains the generation
of man, animals, plants, and elements, but
even that of heaven and the gods, by reflected
representations and images extracted from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
Divine Creator, which, by an harmonic motion,
are ranged according to the properties of
numbers in the most perfect order. The
universe, according to him, is a copy of the
Deity: time, space, motion, and matter, are
images of his attributes; and secondary and
particular causes are results of numerical and
harmonical qualities of those representations.
The world is the most perfect being, and to
have a complete perfection it was necessary that
it contained every other animal, every possible
representation, and every imaginable form, of
the creative faculty. The essence of all generation
consists in the unity and harmony of
the number Three, or of the triangle, viz. that
<i>which</i> generates, that <i>in which</i> generation is
performed, and that <i>which is</i> engendered.
The succession of individuals in the species
is only a fugitive image of the immutable
eternity of this triangular harmony, the universal
prototype of every existence and every
generation; for this reason two individuals are
required to produce a third, and it is this which
constitutes the essential order of father, mother,
and child.</p>

<p>This philosopher is a painter only of ideas;
disengaged from matter he elevates into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
regions of abstraction, and, losing sight of sensible
objects, perceives and contemplates the
intellectual alone. One cause, one end, and
one sole mode, form the whole of his perceptions.
God is the cause, perfection the end,
and harmonic representations the modes. What
can be a more sublime idea! This plan of
philosophy is replete with simplicity, and the
views truly noble! but how void and destitute
for speculation? We are not purely spiritual
beings, nor have we the power to give a real
existence to our ideas. Confined to matter,
our rather dependent on what causes our sensations,
the real substance can never be produced
by the abstracted. I answer Plato in his own
language, "The Creator realizes every thing
he conceives; his perceptions engender existence:
the created being, on the contrary, conceives
nothing by retrenching them but from
reality, and the production of his ideas do not
amount to any thing."</p>

<p>Let us then content ourselves with a more
humble and more material philosophy; and by
keeping within the sphere Nature has allotted
us, let us examine the rash steps and the rapid
flight of those who attempt to soar beyond it.
All this Pythagorean philosophy, which is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
purely intellectual, turns entirely on two principles,
one of which is false and the other precarious:
those are, the real power of abstraction,
and the actual existence of final causes.
To take numbers for real beings; to say that
unity is a general individual, which not only
represents every individual, but even communicates
existence to them; to pretend that
unity has the actual power to engender another
unity nearly similar to itself, and constituting
two individuals, two sides of a triangle, which
can have no bound or perfection without a third
side, or by a third individual, which they necessarily
engender. To regard numbers, geometrical
lines, and metaphysical abstractions,
as efficient and real physical causes, on which
the formation of the elements, the generation
of animals and plants, and all the phenomena
of Nature depend, seems to me to be the most
absurd abuse of reason, and the greatest obstacle
that can be put against the advancement of
our knowledge. Besides, what can be more
false than such suppositions? Admitting, with
Plato and Malebranche, that matter does not
exist, that external objects are only ideal images
of the creative faculty, and that we perceive
every thing in the Deity, must it be concluded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
from thence that our ideas should be of the same
order as those of the Creator, or that they can
produce existences? Are not we dependent on
our sensations? Whether the objects that cause
them are real or not; whether this cause of
our sensations exists outwardly or inwardly;
whether it be the Creator or matter we perceive,
what does it signify to us? Are we less
certain of being always affected in the same
manner by the same causes? Have not our
sensations an invariable order of existence, and
a necessary relation between them and the objects?
This, therefore, is what must constitute
the principles of our philosophy; and what
has no relation with it is vain, useless, and false
in the application. Can a triangular harmony
form the substance of the elements? Is fire,
as Plato affirms, an acute triangle, and light
and heat properties of this triangle? Air and
water, are they rectangular and equilateral
triangles? Is the form of the terrestrial element
a square, because, being the least perfect
of all the four elements, it recedes as much as
possible from a triangle without losing its
essence? Do the male and female embrace
only to complete the triangle of generation?
These platonic ideas have two very different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
aspects. In speculation they seem to flow from
noble and sublime principles, but in application
nothing but false and puerile consequences can
be drawn from them.</p>

<p>Is it difficult to discover that our ideas proceed
only from our senses? that the things we
look on as real and existing are those of which
our senses have always rendered us the same testimony?
that those which we conceive to have
certain existence are those which ever present
themselves in the same order? that consequently
our ideas, very far from being the causes of
things, are only effects, and so far from resembling
particular things, become less similar to
the objects as they are more general; that at
length our mental abstractions are only negative
beings, which do not exist even intellectually
but by the retrenchment which we make
of sensible qualities to real beings.</p>

<p>From hence is it not plain that abstractions
can never become principles, neither of existence
nor real knowledge? on the contrary,
our knowledge can only proceed from the
results of properly comparing our sensations.
These results are what is termed <i>experience</i>,
the sole source of all real science. The adoption
of every other principle is an abuse, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
every edifice built on abstracted ideas is a temple
founded on error.</p>

<p>Error bears a much more extended signification
in philosophy than in morality: in morals
a thing may be false, only because it is misrepresented.
Metaphysical falsehood consists
not in misrepresentation alone, but in crediting
that which has no existence, and even
in not being of any mode whatever. It is
in this kind of error, of the first order, that
the Platonists, the Sceptics, and the Egotists
have fallen into, their false suppositions have
obscured the natural light of truth, clouded
reason, and retarded the advancement of philosophy.</p>

<p>The second principle made use of by Plato,
and by most of the speculative philosophers, is a
final cause. Nevertheless, to reduce this principle
to its just value, a single moment of reflection
is only requisite. To say there is light
because we have eyes, and sounds because we
have ears, or to say that we have ears and eyes
because there is light and sound, is it not exactly
the same thing? shall we ever discover any
thing by this mode of explanation? Is it not
evident that final causes are only arbitrary relations
and moral abstractions, which should impose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
on us still less than metaphysical abstractions,
because their origin is less noble and a
more false supposition; and although Leibnitz
has endeavoured to raise this principle to the
highest degree by the name of <i>sufficient reason</i>,
and Plato has represented it by the most flattering
portrait, under the title of <i>perfection</i>, yet it
cannot prevent our seeing it as trifling and precarious.
Are we better acquainted with the
effects of Nature, from being told that nothing
is made without a reason, or that all is made in
view of perfection? What is this sufficient reason?
what is this perfection? are they not
moral beings created by intellects purely human?
are they not arbitrary relations which we
have generalized? on what are they founded? on
moral affinities which, far from producing any
physical or real existence, only alter the reality
and confound the objects of our sensations, perceptions
and knowledge, with those of our sentiments,
our passions and our wills.</p>

<p>I could adduce many arguments on this subject,
but I do not pretend to make a treatise on
philosophy, and shall return to physics, from
which the ideas of Plato on universal generation
made me digress. Aristotle, who was as great
a philosopher as Plato and a much better physician,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
instead of losing himself in the region
of hypotheses, relied, on the contrary, on collected
facts, and speaks in a more intelligible
language.</p>

<p>Matter, which is only a capacity of receiving
forms, takes in generation a form like that
of the individual which furnishes it; and with
respect to the generation of animals that have
sexes, he thinks that the male alone furnishes
the prolific principle, and that the female affords
nothing that can be looked upon as such.<a name="FNanchor_BM_65" id="FNanchor_BM_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_BM_65" class="fnanchor">[BM]</a>
For though he says elsewhere, speaking of animals
in general, that the female emits a seminal
fluid within herself, yet he does not regard that
as a prolific principle: nevertheless, according
to him, the menstrual blood serves for the formation,
growth, and nutriment of the f&#339;tus,
but the efficient principles exist only in the seminal
fluid of the male, which does not act like
matter, but as the cause. Averrhois, Avicenna,
and other philosophers, who followed
the sentiments of Aristotle, have sought for reasons
to prove that females have no prolific fluid;
they urge, that as females have a menstrual
fluid that was necessary and sufficient for generation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
it does not appear natural to suppose
they possess any other; particularly because it
begins to appear, like the seminal fluid in the
males, at the age of puberty; besides, continue
they, if females have really a seminal and prolific
fluid, why do they not produce without the
approach of the male, since they contain the
prolific principle as well as the matter necessary
for the nutriment and growth of the embryo?
This last reason seems to be the only one which
merits any attention. The menstrual blood
seems to be necessary for the support, nutriment,
and growth of the f&#339;tus, but it can have
no part in the first formation, which is made by
the mixture of two fluids alike prolific. Females
therefore may have, as well as the males,
a prolific fluid for the formation of the embryo,
besides the menstrual blood for its nutriment
and expansion; and certainly a female being
possessed of a prolific fluid, extracted from all
parts of her body, as well as the necessary
means of nourishment and expansion, it is no
impossible imagination that she would produce
females without any communication with the
male. It must be allowed, that this metaphysical
reasoning which the Aristotelians adopt to
prove that females have no prolific fluid, may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
become the most considerable objection that can
be made against all systems of generation, and
particularly against our explanation.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_BM_65" id="Footnote_BM_65"></a><a href="#FNanchor_BM_65"><span class="label">[BM]</span></a> See Aristotle, de gen. lib. i. cap. 20 and lib. xi. cap. 4.</p></div>

<p>Let us suppose, it may be said, as you have
attempted to prove, that the superfluous organic
molecules are sent back into the testicles
and seminal vessels of the male, why, by the
power of your supposed attracting forces, do
they not form small organized beings, perfectly
resembling the male? and for the same
reason similar beings in the female? If you answer,
that there is an appearance that the liquor
of the male contains only males, and that of
the female only females, but that all these
perish for want of the necessary means for expansion,
and that there are only those formed
by the mixture of both which can expand and
come into the world; may we not be asked
why this mode of generation, which is the
most complicated, difficult, and least abundant,
is that which Nature prefers in so striking a
manner, that almost all animals multiply by
this mode of communication of the male with
the female?</p>

<p>I shall content myself at present with answering,
that the fact is such as we have represented
it; the objection becomes a fact question;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
to which, as we have observed, there is no
other solution to be given than that of the fact
itself. It may be insisted, it is the most complicated
mode of production; yet this mode,
which appears the most complicated to us, is
certainly the most simple for nature, because,
as we have remarked, what happens the most
often, however difficult it may appear to our
ideas, must in reality be the most simple; which
does not prevent us from conceiving it to be
complex, as we judge of it according to that
knowledge which our senses and reflections
can give us thereon.</p>

<p>The assertion of the Aristotelians, that females
have no prolific fluid, must fall to the
ground, if we pay attention to the resemblance
of children to their mothers, of mules to the
female that produces them, of mongrels and
mulattos, all of which resemble more the mother
than the father. If, besides these, we
consider the organs of females are, like those
of the males, formed so as to prepare and
receive the seminal fluid, we shall be readily
persuaded that such a fluid must exist, whether
it resides in the spermatic vessels, the testicles,
or in the matrix: or whether it issues, when
provoked, by the passages of de Graaf, situated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
at the neck, and near the external orifice
of the urethra.</p>

<p>But it is right here to examine the ideas of
Aristotle more generally on the subject of
generation, because this great philosopher has
written the most on the subject, and treated
it the most generally. He distinguishes animals
into three classes; first, those which have
blood, and, excepting some few, multiply by
copulation; the second, those which have no
blood, but, being at the same time both male
and female, produce of themselves, and without
copulation; and thirdly, those bred by putrefaction,
which do not owe their origin to parents
of any kind. I shall first remark, that this division
must not be admitted of; for though in
fact all kinds of animals which have blood
are composed of males and females, it is not
equally true, that animals who have no blood
are for the most part male and female in one;
for we are only acquainted with the snail and
worm on earth which are in this state; nor
can we ascertain whether all shell-fish, and
other animals which have no blood, be hermaphrodites.
With respect to those animals
which he says proceed from putrefaction, as
he has not enumerated them, many exceptions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
occur; for most of the kinds which the
ancients thought engendered by putrefaction
have been discovered by the moderns to be the
produce of eggs.</p>

<p>After this he makes a second division of
animals; those which have the faculty of
moving themselves progressively, as walking,
flying, swimming, and those which have no
such faculty. All animals which can move,
and have blood, have sexes; but those which,
like oysters, are adherent, or who scarcely
move at all, have no sex, and are, in this respect
like plants, distinguished only, as he
says, into males and females by difference of
size. It is not yet ascertained whether shell-fish
have sexes or not; there are in the oyster-kind
fruitful individuals, and others which
are not so; those which are fruitful are distinguished
by a delicate border which surrounds
the body of the oyster, and they are called
males.<a name="FNanchor_BN_66" id="FNanchor_BN_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_BN_66" class="fnanchor">[BN]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_BN_66" id="Footnote_BN_66"></a><a href="#FNanchor_BN_66"><span class="label">[BN]</span></a> See the observation of M. Deslandes, in the Tracte de la
raine, Paris, 1747.</p></div>

<p>But to proceed, the male, according to
Aristotle, includes the principle of generative,
motion, and the female contains the material
parts of generation. The organs which serve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
for this purpose are different in the different
kind of animals; the principal are the testicles
in the males, and the matrix in the females.
Quadrupeds, birds, and cetaceous animals,
have testicles; fish and serpents are deprived of
them; but they have both proper conduits to
receive and prepare the seed. These essential
parts are always double, both in the male and
female, and serve in males to stop the motion
of the blood, which forms the seed. This he
proves by the example of birds, whose testicles
swell in the season of their amours, and diminish
so greatly when this season is over that
they are scarcely perceptible.</p>

<p>All quadrupeds, as horses, oxen, &amp;c. which
are clothed with hair, and cetaceous fishes, as
dolphins and whales, are viviparous; but cartilaginous
animals, and vipers, are not truly viviparous,
because they produce an egg within
themselves before the live animal appears.
Oviparous animals are of two kinds, those
which produce perfect eggs, as birds, lizards,
turtles, &amp;c. and those which produce imperfect
eggs, as fishes, whose eggs augment and come
to perfection after they have been laid in the
water by the female; and in all kinds of oviparous
animals, excepting birds, the females
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
are generally larger than the males, as fishes,
lizards, &amp;c.</p>

<p>After having mentioned these general varieties
in animals, Aristotle begins with examining
the opinion of the ancient philosophers,
that the seed, as well of the male as of
the female, proceeded from all parts of the
body; he declares against this opinion, because,
he says, although children often resemble
their fathers and mothers, they also
sometimes resemble their grandfathers; and,
besides, they resemble their parents by the voice,
hair, nails, carriage, and manner of walking.
Now the seed, he continues, cannot proceed
from the hair, voice, nails, or any external
quality, like that of walking; therefore
children do not resemble their parents because
the seed comes from every part of the body,
but for some other reason. It appears to me
unnecessary here to point out the weakness of
these arguments; I shall only observe that it
appears to me this great man expressly sought
after methods to separate himself from the
sentiments of those philosophers who preceded
him; and I am persuaded, that whoever reads
his treatise on generation with attention, will
discover that a strong design of giving a new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
system, different from that of the ancients,
obliged him always to give the preference to
the least probable reasons, and to elude, as
much as he could, the force of proofs, when
they were contrary to his general principles of
philosophy.</p>

<p>According to Aristotle the seminal liquor is
secreted from the blood; and the menstrua, in
females, is a similar secretion, and the only one
which serves for the purpose of generation. Females,
he says, have no other prolific liquor;
there is, therefore, no mixture of that of the
male with that of the female. He pretends to
prove this from some women conceiving without
receiving the least pleasure, and because
few women emit this liquor externally during
copulation; that in general those who are
brown, and have a masculine appearance, do
not emit at all, yet engender equally with those
who are more fair in complexion and feminine
in appearance, and whose emissions are
considerable. Thus he concludes woman furnishes
nothing but the menstrual. This blood
is the matter of generation; and the seminal
fluid of the male does not contribute as matter
but as form; it is the efficient cause, the
principle of motion; it is to generation what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
the sculptor is to a block of marble: the
liquor of the male is the sculptor, the menstrual
blood the marble, and the f&#339;tus the
image.</p>

<p>The menstrual blood receives from the male
seed a kind of soul, which gives life and motion.
This soul is neither material nor immaterial,
because it can neither act upon matter
nor enter in generation as matter, the menstrual
blood being all that is necessary for that
purpose. It is, says our philosopher, a spirit,
whose substance is like that of the starry region.
The heart is the first work of this
soul; it contains in itself the principle of its
own growth; and it has the power to arrange
the other members. The menstrual blood
contains every other principle of all the parts
of the f&#339;tus: the soul, or spirit, of the male
seed, makes the heart begin to act, and that
communicates the power of bringing the other
viscera to action; and thus, successively, is
every part of the animal unfolded and brought
into motion. All this appeared very clear to
our philosopher; there only remained to him
one doubt, which was, whether the heart was
realized before the blood; and in fact he had
reason for this doubt; for, although he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
adopted the opinion of the heart existing first,
Harvey has since pretended, by reasons of the
same kind as those used by Aristotle, that it
was not the heart but the blood which is first
realized.</p>

<p>This is the system that great philosopher has
given us of generation, and I shall leave it to
the opinion of the reader whether that of the
ancients, which he rejects, can be more obscure
or more absurd than his; nevertheless,
his system has been followed by most of the
learned. Harvey has not only adopted the
ideas of Aristotle, but has added new ones of
the same kind. As this system of generation
is of the same kind as the rest of Aristotle's
philosophy, where form and matter are the
grand principles; where the vegetative and
sensitive are the active beings in Nature; and
where final causes are real objects; I am not
surprised that it has been received by scholastic
authors; but it is astonishing that so able a
physician and observer of Nature as Harvey
was, should be carried away with the stream,
while every physician followed the opinion of
Hippocrates and Galen; which we shall explain
in order. We must not, however, imbibe
a disadvantageous idea of Aristotle from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
above exposition of his System of Generation.
It would be like judging of Descartes by his
Treatise on Man. The explanations which
these two philosophers give of the formation of
the f&#339;tus should not be considered as complete
systems on the subject of generation; they are
rather general consequences drawn from their
philosophical principles.</p>
